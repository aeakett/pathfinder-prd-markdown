# Spells

Beyond the spells presented in the *Core Rulebook* exist countless more
mystical discoveries and the secret tricks of spellcasters arcane and
divine. The following lists summarize all of the new spells presented in
this book, broken down by class. Note that, with the exception of the
antipaladin's full spell list, the lists here summarize only new spells
from this book. An **M** or **F**appearing at the end of a spell's name
in the spell lists denotes a *material* or *focus* component,
respectively, not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**Full Spell Lists**^^: The full lists of available spells for the
spellcasting base classes introduced in this book appear in Chapter Two
at the end of each spellcasting class's entry. Note that oracles use the
same spell list as clerics.

**Order of Presentation**^^: In the spell lists and the short
descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical
order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a
spell's name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell is
alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice**^^: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character
levels” for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of
creatures.

**Caster Level**^^: A spell's power often depends on caster level, which
is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a
particular spell. The word “level” in the short descriptions that follow
always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters**^^: “Creature” and “character” are used
synonymously in the short description.
