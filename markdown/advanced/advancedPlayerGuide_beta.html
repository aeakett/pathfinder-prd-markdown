<h1 id="races">Races</h1>
<p>The choice of character race is foundational to designing a character, whether you want to work within established archetypes for that race or to intentionally play against them. Working with racial archetypes can be achieved with a bit of roleplaying—whether developing a unique personality and style for every character or adopting one as clichéd as a surly dwarf fighter with a huge axe and a tankard of ale. The seven player character races in the Pathfinder RPG—dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans—are no more uniform than are humans in the real world. This chapter is meant to offer game rules and options for how to reflect that diversity of attitude, heritage, and experience and how it affects the way the races interact with the various adventuring careers presented in the Pathfinder RPG core rules.</p>
<h2 id="racial-attitudes">Racial Attitudes</h2>
<p>The following race discussions describe the general attitudes held by each race toward the 11 base classes in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> and the six new base classes introduced here in the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>. Humans tend to fit easily into every class, while other races favor some occupations much more highly than others, with a handful of classes earning the contempt and suspicion of certain races. These expanded looks at racial attitudes can help give definition and depth to each race and spark ideas for how and why members of that race might be inclined to pursue one class rather than another, or what challenges they might face in adopting a career that goes against the grain of their society.</p>
<p>These attitudes should never be considered restrictions on what classes players may choose, regardless of their characters' race, nor are they a prescription that demands player characters think or act a certain way toward members of a class described as being highly favored (or highly disfavored) by members of their race. As always, players are the ones in charge of their own characters. These attitudes instead describe the common attitudes of typical NPC members of their race and the values and attitudes their characters may have been raised with. Characters can learn these typical attitudes about their class with a DC 10 <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) check (DC 5 for attitudes of their own race).</p>
<h2 id="racial-traits">Racial Traits</h2>
<p>The following race discussions also describe alternate racial traits for each character race. It is important to note that these racial traits are not the same as the trait rules found in Chapter 8 of this book (and originating in other Pathfinder products). Those traits are effectively half-feats, intended to tie characters to the specific nations, cultures, regions, and races of the Golarion campaign world. Racial traits, on the other hand, are those racial abilities described at the bottom of <a href="../races.html">each race's description</a>. Some races have few racial traits, like half-orcs and humans. Others, like dwarves and gnomes, have many. All of these racial traits represent typical members of the race and the kinds of special abilities they gain from their heritage, whether from biology, racial attitudes, or otherwise.</p>
<p>This chapter also contains a list of alternate class features for each race. Some of them play on racial archetypes not reflected in the standard racial traits, like a gnome's love of languages or tinkering or a halfling's mastery of thrown items or of slipping through a battlefield under the feet of larger races. In order to choose one of these racial traits, you must exchange one or more of the existing racial traits available to your character. These racial traits replace a character's normal racial traits; they are not abilities gained in addition to them. In many cases, racial abilities are exchanged on a one-to-one basis; you give up one racial ability from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> to gain one presented in this book. In other cases, you may have to exchange more than one racial trait to take one of these alternate racial traits. For example, a gnome may eschew the militant path and exchange defensive training and hatred for the gift of tongues, while other magic-using gnomes might forgo the traditional gnome specialty of illusion magic to become a magical linguist or even a pyromaniac.</p>
<p>You can exchange one or several of your character's normal racial traits, but of course you cannot exchange the same racial trait more than once. If a human exchanges the skilled trait to become either a child of the fields or a child of the street, she cannot exchange it twice to take both new traits. However, she could choose one of those as an alternate racial trait while also exchanging her bonus feat racial trait to gain an eye for talent.</p>
<p>As with any alternate or optional rule, you must first get the permission of your GM to exchange any of your character's normal racial traits for those in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="racial-favored-classes">Racial Favored Classes</h2>
<p>The final section for each racial discussion describes alternative benefits for members of that race taking certain classes as a favored class. The normal benefit of having a favored class is simple and effective: your character gains one extra hit point or one extra skill rank each time she gains a level in that class (or in either of two classes, if she is a half-elf). The alternate favored class abilities listed here may not have as broad an appeal as the standard choices. They are designed to reflect flavorful options that might be less useful in general but prove handy in the right situations or for a character with the right focus. Most of them play off racial archetypes, like a half-orc's toughness and proclivity for breaking things or elven grace and finesse.</p>
<p>In most cases, these benefits are gained on a level-by-level basis—your character gains the specified incremental benefit each time she gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves. For example, a human with paladin as a favored class may choose to gain 1 point of energy resistance each time she gains a level; choosing this benefit twice increases this resistance bonus to 2, 10 times raises it to 10, and so on.</p>
<p>In some cases this benefit may eventually hit a fixed numerical limit, after which selecting that favored class benefit has no effect. Of course, you can still select the bonus hit point or skill rank as your favored class benefit, so there is always a reward for sticking with a favored class.</p>
<p>Finally, some of these alternate favored class benefits only add +1/2, +1/3, +1/4, or +1/6 to a roll (rather than +1) each time the benefit is selected; when applying this result to the die roll, round down (minimum 0). For example, a dwarf with rogue as his favored class adds +1/2 to his trap sense ability regarding stone traps each time he selects the alternate rogue favored class benefit; though this means the net effect is +0 after selecting it once (because +1/2 rounds down to +0), after 20 levels this benefit gives the dwarf a +10 bonus to his trap sense (in addition to the base value from being a 20th-level rogue).</p>
<p>As in the previous section, what is presented here is a set of alternative benefits that characters of each race may choose instead of the normal benefits for their favored class. Thus, rather than taking an extra hit point or an extra skill rank, players may choose for their characters to gain the benefit listed here. This is not a permanent or irrevocable choice; just as characters could alternate between taking skill ranks and hit points when they gain levels in their favored class, these benefits provide a third option, and characters may freely alternate between them.</p>
<p>As with any alternate or optional rule, consult with your GM to determine whether exchanging normal favored class benefits for those in this chapter will be allowed.</p>
<h2 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h2>
<p>Known as skilled craftsmen, fierce warriors, and pious clerics, members of the dwarven race prove just as diverse as the human folk who dwell on the surface. Certainly fewer of their number turn to the arcane arts than do elves, but a number of powerful sorcerer and wizard clans are found within the dwarven ranks. Likewise, some dwarves turn to thievery and cunning, taking up the role of rogue or even assassin.</p>
<p>In addition to this diversity in profession, dwarves are more varied in their backgrounds than they might first appear. Not every dwarf lives so close to the surface and receives training to fight against giants. Similarly, some dwarves did not come of age fighting against goblins and orcs, instead facing other, equally menacing foes. Such dwarves might have different racial traits than those who are raised in a more traditional lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="dwarf-adventurers">Dwarf Adventurers</h3>
<p>Dwarves who chose to become adventurers tend to be martial characters, from berserk barbarians to hammer-wielding clerics. Regardless of their chosen professions, dwarven adventurers are always ready for a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: While many respected dwarves practice alchemy, few take on the role of alchemist—except in the interest of creating magical beers. Dwarves see alchemists as odd folk, best to be avoided though still respected.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Although their kin usually call them berserkers, dwarf barbarians are a valuable part of many dwarven armies. Those who strike out on their own to become adventurers do so in search of greater challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Dwarves value their long and glorious history above all else. Dwarf bards often receive intense training in their history, reciting tales and ballads that recount their past. Of course, every dwarven bard also knows at least a dozen bawdy drinking songs.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Dwarf cavaliers are almost unheard of; the few dwarven cavaliers are almost exclusively surface dwellers, riding on ponies or even giant boars. Not surprisingly, many dwarves see cavaliers as odd folk, not to be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Dwarves have a close connection with their gods and a long tradition of producing powerful and influential clerics. Dwarves selected for a life of devotion are trained from an early age, but after training, they are free to explore the world and spread the faith.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: The general lack of flora below ground leads few dwarves to take up the druid's call. Those who find a bond with nature are either drawn to subterranean forms of life or move to the surface to adopt the environments that land has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Dwarf fighters hold a position of respect and authority in most dwarven cultures. They are a necessity of life in the harsh environments underground, and many dwarves are trained in martial combat from a young age.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Although not unheard of, dwarves rarely commit treason against their own people. As a result, the few dwarves who take up the mantle of inquisitor spend most of their time traveling the world to protect their people from outside threats.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: While many dwarves possess the discipline to take on the role of monk, most turn to more traditional forms of combat that employ heavy armor and a trusty axe. Most dwarf monks congregate in small enclaves of like-minded individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Most dwarf oracles draw their power from the earth around them or the spirits of their ancestors, making them respected members of dwarven society. While they are not venerated like the clergy, dwarf oracles are often consulted in times of crisis and called on for aid in times of war.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Few dwarves aspire to paladinhood. Blending both devotion and martial skill, dwarf paladins are just as likely to be crusaders for dwarven interests as defenders guarding dwarven strongholds.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Dwarves are renowned for holding grudges. It should come as no surprise that a number of dwarves decide to become rangers focused on destroying the enemies of their people.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Dwarves who turn to the art of subterfuge tend to focus on working with traps and surprising enemies rather than pickpocketing and double-talk.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Dwarven society prizes those few among them who draw their power from benevolent or noble bloodlines, but shun those tainted by darker influences.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Most dwarves do not understand the powerful bond between a summoner and his eidolon, making this a rare profession for the stout folk. The eidolons of dwarf summoners often look similar to earth elementals or iron golems.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Members of dwarven society who form a pact with a familiar and take on the title of witch do so in secrecy. Their kin are distrustful of such agreements, preferring instead to rely upon the power of their deities.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Dwarves have never had a long tradition of arcane magic, and its study is a rare thing, though still more common than natural-born sorcery. Forgoing traditional dwarven training in favor of arcane study marks most wizards as outsiders among their young peers, though aged and learned wizards are well respected.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits might be selected instead of existing dwarf racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Enmity</strong>: Dwarves have long been in conflict with elves, especially the hated drow. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the elf subtype. This racial trait replaces the hatred racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Craftsman</strong>: Dwarves are known for their superior craftsmanship when it comes to metal and stone works. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on all <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> or <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> checks that create objects from metal or stone. This racial trait replaces the greed racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Warrior</strong>: Dwarves with this racial trait grew up facing the abominations that live deep beneath the surface. They receive a +2 dodge bonus to AC against monsters of the aberration type and a +2 racial bonus to their CMB on attempts made to grapple such creatures (or to continue a grapple). This racial trait replaces the defensive training racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Lorekeeper</strong>: Dwarves keep extensive records about their history and the world around them. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (history) skill checks that pertain to dwarves or their enemies. They can make such skill checks untrained. This racial trait replaces the greed racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Resistant</strong>: Some of the older dwarven clans are particularly resistant to magic. Dwarves with this racial trait gain spell resistance equal to 5 + their character level. This resistance can be lowered for 1 round as a standard action. Dwarves with this racial trait take a –2 penalty on all concentration checks made in relation to arcane spells. This racial trait replaces the hardy racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Relentless</strong>: Dwarves are skilled at pushing their way through a battlefield, tossing aside lesser foes with ease. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver checks made to bull rush or overrun an opponent. This bonus only applies while both the dwarf and his opponent are standing on the ground. This racial trait replaces the stability racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Stonesinger</strong>: Some dwarves' affinity with the earth grants them greater powers. Dwarves with this racial trait are treated as 1 level higher when casting spells with the earth descriptor or using granted powers of the Earth domain, the bloodline powers of the earth elemental bloodline, and revelations of the oracle's stone mystery. This ability does not give the dwarf early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers the dwarf could use without this ability. This racial trait replaces the stonecunning racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Stubborn</strong>: Dwarves are renowned for being stubborn. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Will saves to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the enchantment (charm) and enchantment (compulsion) schools. In addition, if they fail such a save, they receive another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming it has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the dwarf has a similar ability from another source (such as a rogue's slippery mind), he can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try one on the second round if the first reroll ability fails). This racial trait replaces the hardy racial trait.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever he gains a level in a favored class, a dwarf has the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon his favored class. The following options are available to all dwarves who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Add 1 to the dwarf's total number of rage rounds per day.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Select one domain power granted at 1st level that is normally usable for a number of times per day equal to 3 + the cleric's Wisdom modifier. The cleric adds 1/2 to the number of uses per day of that domain power.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Add +1 to the fighter's CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Reduce the non-proficient penalty for one weapon by 1. When the non-proficient penalty for a weapon becomes 0 because of this ability, the oracle is treated as having the appropriate Martial or <a href="../feats.html#_exotic-weapon-proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</a> feat with that weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Add a +1 bonus on concentration checks when casting paladin spells.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on wild empathy checks to influence animals and magical beasts that live underground.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on <a href="../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks regarding stone traps and a +1/2 bonus to trap sense regarding stone traps.</p>
<h2 id="elves">Elves</h2>
<p>Renowned for their grace, wisdom, and near-immortality, elves are held in high esteem by most other races, especially for their mastery of magic and encyclopedic collections of lore. However, members of this race often find themselves hemmed in and isolated by vastly more numerous and aggressive younger races. Still, while elven enclaves tend to embody the beauty and spirit of their environment, learning and growing from it, elf adventurers carry the strength and glory of elven culture with them into the world, often at the point of a sword or wand.</p>
<p>The classic vision of elves as wardens of the forest is accurate but incomplete, as elves adapt readily to many environments, from the harshest desert to the deepest sea. Others tap into mysteries and magics outside the realms usually embraced by their kindred. Such elves have different racial traits than those who are raised in a more traditional elven lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="elf-adventurers">Elf Adventurers</h3>
<p>Elves who chose to become adventurers usually follow a martial path, pursue mastery of arcane magic, or seek a career that blends the two. Elves prefer subtlety to outright conflict, but are eager to exhibit their superiority to other races, employing force if finesse and flair are insufficient for the task.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Elves favor classical arcane disciplines over the experimentation and pseudoscience of alchemy, often deriding it as a crude imitation of traditional magic. Elf alchemists often seek the adventuring life to escape the scorn of their fellows.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Elf barbarians typically live deep in deserts or jungles, led by wise and mystical elders. They often venture from their homelands in service of their people or to see the world beyond their homes.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Elves love art in all its forms. Their sweeping arias, ancient poetry, and graceful dances are the envy of cultured audiences, just as their finesse with arms garners the envy of common warriors.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Elf cavaliers have a long tradition in the ancient noble houses, pursuing and protecting honor with elegance. Their sleek mounts show both great resilience and devotion.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Elves follow many faiths, and because of their long lives many elves view themselves as blessed by the gods. Many stand for naturalistic philosophies or ancient divine patrons who embody the traits of their people.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Elves have an instinctual bond with nature and the mysterious spirits within it, some even revering such powers, binding nature's forces to themselves and themselves to nature.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Elf fighters are respected for their lightness on their feet, delicate yet deadly precision, and mastery of centuries-old martial traditions.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Though as a race elves prize freedom and individuality, they are also great traditionalists and quite suspicious of outsiders. Elf inquisitors are not loved, but their judgments and authority are respected.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Elves are contemplative by nature and appreciate those who focus on inward calm and stillness of mind. Elf monks often adopt ageless mantras and examples of balance and finesse in nature as guides.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Elf oracles are quite common and highly respected as keepers of the mysteries of their peoples' ancestors and secrets that predate the world's countless younger races.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Elf paladins adopt and defend the ancient strictures of their deities, defending their people and soil from all who would despoil their sacred homelands.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Elves make masterful hunters and scouts, attuned to the environment, keenly aware of their surroundings, and always ready to protect their homelands or punish those who would intrude upon their dominion.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: While thieves, brigands, and their ilk are rare within elven society, elf rogues are common as scouts, infiltrators, and even assassins.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Magic sings in the blood of all elves, and all sorcerous bloodlines might be found among them, though sorcerers rarely garner the respect wizards enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Elves have a long tradition of alliance with magical creatures due to their affinity for the mystic arts. While less numerous than sorcerers or wizards, summoners are well represented in elven armies, their eidolons often gossamer creatures of deceptive strength and power.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Treating with ageless, inscrutable powers of the land, elf witches blend their understanding of nature and mastery of magic into potent hexes and strange arcana. Many develop ties with creatures of their homelands, taking them as familiars to further strengthen their ties to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Elves cultivate an ancient tradition of magical lore and research in all fields of specialization. For those with the talent to excel, wizardry is one of the surest paths to prestige in elven society.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits-1">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits replace existing elf racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Desert Runner</strong>: Some elves thrive in the deepest deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. Elves with this racial trait receive a +4 racial bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves to avoid fatigue, exhaustion, or ill effects from running, forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments. This racial trait replaces the elven magic racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Dreamspeaker</strong>: A few elves have the ability to tap into the power of sleep, dreams, and prescient reverie. Elves with this racial trait add +1 to saving throw DCs for spells of the divination school and sleep effects they cast. In addition, elves with a Charisma of 15 or higher may use <em><a href="../spells/dream.html#_dream">dream</a></em> once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level is equal to the elf's character level). This racial trait replaces the elven immunities racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Eternal Grudge</strong>: Elves with this racial trait grew up in secluded, isolationist communities where generations-old slights and quarrels linger as eternal blood feuds. They receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoids of the dwarf and orc subtypes due to special training against these hated foes. This racial trait replaces the elven magic racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Lightbringer</strong>: Many elves revere the sun, moon, and stars, but some are literally infused with the radiant power of the heavens. Elves with this racial trait are immune to light-based blindness and dazzle effects, and are treated as one level higher when determining the effects of any light-based spell or effect they cast (including spell-like and supernatural abilities). Elves with Intelligence 10 or higher may use <em><a href="../spells/light.html#_light">light</a></em> at will as a spell-like ability. This racial trait replaces the elven immunities and elven magic racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Hunter</strong>: Elves are renowned for their subtlety and skill. Elves with this racial trait reduce the penalty for using <a href="../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a> while moving by 5 and can make <a href="../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a> checks while running at a –20 penalty (this number includes the penalty reduction from this racial trait). This racial trait replaces the elven magic racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit of the Waters</strong>: Some elves have adapted to life in tune with the sea or along the reedy depths of wild rivers and lakes. They gain a +4 racial bonus on <a href="../skills/swim.html#_swim">Swim</a> checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language. They are proficient with longspear, trident, and net. This racial trait replaces elven magic and weapon familiarity racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Woodcraft</strong>: Elves know the deep secrets of the wild like no others, especially those of the forests. Elves with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) and <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks. In forest terrain, these bonuses improve to +2. This racial trait replaces the elven magic racial trait.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options-1">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, elves have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to all elves who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Add 1 to the elf's base speed. In combat this has no effect unless the elf has selected this reward 5 times (or another increment of 5); a speed of 34 feet is effectively the same as a speed of 30 feet, for example. This bonus stacks with a class's fast movement feature and applies only under the same conditions as that ability.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Add +1 to the elf's CMD when resisting a disarm or sunder attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Add +1 hit point to the cavalier's mount. If the elf ever replaces his mount, the new mount gains these bonus hit points. These bonuses only apply to a single mount gained as part of the cavalier's class.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Add +1 to the elf's CMD when resisting a disarm or sunder attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Choose a weapon from the following list: longbow, longsword, rapier, shortbow, short sword, or any weapon with “elven” in its name. Add a +1/2 circumstance bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls with that weapon (maximum bonus of +4). This bonus does not stack with <a href="../feats.html#_critical-focus">Critical Focus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Select one bloodline power at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier. The sorcerer adds +1/2 to the number of uses per day of that bloodline power.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Select one arcane school power at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the wizard's Intelligence modifier. The wizard adds +1/2 to the number of uses per day of that arcane school power.</p>
<h2 id="gnomes">Gnomes</h2>
<p>Gnomes are a quirky race. They take mistakes in stride, turning derision into mirth and baffling their foes, if only long enough to work a bit of mischief at their expense. Gnomes love magic and music, but also have a love of craft, clockworks, and the work of their hands. Whatever their passion, gnomes throw themselves into it absolutely. Once obsessed and absorbed, a gnome can scarcely think of anything else, regardless of whether his mind bends to new adventures at home or in the great wide world.</p>
<p>Given their fey heritage, many gnomes love wild places where their fey cousins congregate. Increasing numbers of gnomes, however, eschew these places for the cities, their natural curiosity and love of creation drawing them to commerce, trade, and manufactories where they can follow and promote the latest discoveries. Such gnomes often have different racial traits than those raised among the rocks and trees.</p>
<h3 id="gnome-adventurers">Gnome Adventurers</h3>
<p>Gnomes ply their intellect and force of personality to overcome challenges. Though generally good-humored and tolerant, gnomes can swiftly turn fierce if backed into a corner.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Alchemy is one of the most respected careers for a gnome, melding their love of magic with practical applied theory, all wrapped in a field in which discovery is an everyday opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Gnome barbarians typically rise among those who have lived long among their wild fey kin or the beasts of the wilderness, going near-feral as incarnate spirits of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Many gnomes are obsessive collectors of stories, songs, and jokes, making gnome bards renowned for their vast repertoires, energetic deliveries, and weaving of magic into their performances.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Although gnome cavaliers are rare, gnomes swear honest oaths, and might master a broad array of tactics to defend the people and the lands they love.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Gnomes often become servants of the gods, especially deities of art, music, exploration, discovery, and merrymaking, blending their fervor for creation with true religious zeal.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Many gnomes hew to the earth and forests, taking up the druidic mantle and staying in close communion with animals and the spirits of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Gnome fighters are a tenacious lot, eager to prove that even the smallest combatant can be a titan on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Some gnomes learn the harshness of the world, and especially harder-hearted races, all too personally, donning the mantle of the inquisitor to defend their people and protect their lands from callous souls.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Gnomes are colorful, passionate, and flamboyant by nature, adopting such whimsy into their vision of physical and natural perfection. Many gnome martial styles thus prove unpredictable, more akin to improvised dances than long-practiced techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: As inheritors of ancient fey spirits, gnomes take quite naturally to oracular devotion, interpreting otherworldly portents and whispers of the natural forces.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Gnomes who find their lives changed by religious zeal or the passion to protect those around them might adopt the paladin's calling. Most find their ability to speak with animals an especial boon, both in communicating with their mounts and in hunting down evil-doers.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Militant gnomes most often become rangers, playing upon their innate relationship with nature and ability to commune with its creations.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Gnome rogues typically master a variety of skills, plying others with their charismatic personalities, and even adding a touch of magic to enhance their skills at creating and defeating locks and traps.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: The intrinsic arcane power of the fey bloodline is common in many gnome families, though sorcerers of other bloodlines often arise. Most all of these are accepted as normal in gnome society, though those who draw their power from darker sources elicit suspicion and scorn.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Gnomes are inveterate tinkers and endlessly creative, delighting in the design and shaping of eidolons. The servants of gnome summoners often resemble clockwork creations or fairy creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Eagerly embracing weird and ancient powers, gnomes make deceptively capable witches. Most adopt strange or exotic familiars well-suited to their personalities.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Gnomes have an expansive magical tradition, specializing in the realms of illusion and elemental magic. They are much respected as historians, researchers, and academics committed to pushing the boundaries of magical possibility, often by unprecedented leaps.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits-2">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits replace existing gnome racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Academician</strong>: Some gnomes are more academically inclined than their kin. Gnomes with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any one <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill. This racial trait replaces the obsessive racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Eternal Hope</strong>: Gnomes rarely lose hope and are always confident that even hopeless situations will work out. Gnomes with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear and despair effects. Once per day, after rolling a 1 on a d20, the gnome may reroll and use the second result. This racial trait replaces the defensive training and hatred racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Gift of Tongues</strong>: Gnomes love languages and learning about those they meet. Gnomes with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks, and they learn one additional language every time they put a rank in the <a href="../skills/linguistics.html#_linguistics">Linguistics</a> skill.

<p><strong>Magical Linguist</strong>: Gnomes study languages in both their mundane and supernatural manifestations. Gnomes with this racial trait add +1 to the DC of spells they cast with the language-dependent descriptor or those that create glyphs, symbols, or other magical writings. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against such spells.

They are treated as proficient with any weapon they have personally crafted. This racial trait replaces the defensive training and hatred racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Pyromaniac</strong>: Gnomes with this racial trait are treated as one level higher when casting spells with the fire descriptor, using granted powers of the Fire domain, using the bloodline powers of the fire elemental bloodline or the revelations of the oracle's flame mystery, and when determining the damage of alchemist bombs that deal fire damage (this ability does not give gnomes early access to level-based powers, only affecting the powers they could use without this ability). Gnomes with Charisma of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—<em><a href="../spells/dancingLights.html#_dancing-lights">dancing lights</a></em>, <em><a href="../spells/flare.html#_flare">flare</a></em>, <em><a href="../spells/prestidigitation.html#_prestidigitation">prestidigitation</a></em>, <em><a href="../spells/produceFlame.html#_produce-flame">produce flame</a></em>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the gnome's level; the DCs are Charisma-based. This racial trait replaces the gnome magic and illusion resistance racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Warden of Nature</strong>: Gnomes must often protect their homes against unnatural or pestilential infestations. Gnomes with this racial trait get a +2 dodge bonus to AC against aberrations, oozes, and vermin, and a +1 bonus on attack rolls against them because of their special training. This racial trait replaces the defensive training and hatred racial traits.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options-2">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever she gains a level in a favored class, gnomes have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

<h2 id="half-elves">Half-Elves</h2>
<p>Half-elves are the idealized orphans of society, at once both charismatic and passionate, but never quite at home anywhere. Many half-elves throw themselves into social careers quite readily, yet often have a hard time sticking to a single path. Others seek fulfillment in spiritual pursuits or in honing inborn magical talents, while still others give up and resign themselves to lives of isolation in the wild or of misanthropy, living day to day at the expense of others.</p>
<p>Half-elves vary in appearance as much as their human and elven parents do, encompassing every imaginable hue of hair, eye, and skin, yet also possessing an effortless and graceful allure. Half-elves' unique talents also vary a great deal depending on their upbringing, the nature of their bloodlines, the strength of their psyches, and their relationship to their dual nature. Some half-elves have different racial traits than normal for their kind.</p>
<p>Although well represented among the ranks of adventurers and other wanderers, half-elves are rarities in most parts of the world, the fraternization of humans and elves typically leading to feelings of consternation in both races rather than romance. While some half-elves find themselves cherished members of unusual but happy families, this rarely proves the norm. More often, they find themselves shunned or embodiments of burdensome shames. Yet while many possess dark pasts, such hardships prepare them for lives full of challenge and adventure like few members of more unified races could ever know.</p>
<h3 id="half-elf-adventurers">Half-Elf Adventurers</h3>
<p>Half-elf adventurers often specialize in social classes or choose to multiclass, dabbling in several career paths as they try to find the perfect blend to suit their multifaceted personalities.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Half-elves are curious dabblers, and many undertake at least a passing study of alchemy, often showing great skill in the blending and apportioning of volatile elements.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Half-elf barbarians typically hail from the societies of savage parents. While many leave their cultures to escape their differences, others viciously defend their people, ever seeking to prove their worthiness.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Many half-elves gravitate to the bard class, as it binds together their natural allure and social adaptability, often to the adulation of others.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Half-elf cavaliers take the arts of war and gild them with elegance and finesse. The path of the cavalier gives them a code to follow and a master to serve to earn honor and esteem, though elves and humans alike sometimes look at them as pretenders or trespassers within their knightly orders.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Half-elves often feel disconnected from human or elven faiths, but many still choose to follow a divine calling that provides a comfortable context in which to engage with other races in a common faith, or simply for an immanent connection with the divine that renders their uncertainty with other mortals of small consequence.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Half-elves uncertain of their place in civilized society frequently abandon it entirely for the implicit harmony of the natural world. Embracing the connection to nature inherent in their elven blood, many find a tranquility in the wilds no society can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Half-elf fighters are relatively common, as the harsh simplicity of the battlefield holds great appeal for those tired of reconciling their divided natures. Half-elves' varied tastes and skills often make them masters of a dazzling array of weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Facing their own inner turmoil, half-elf inquisitors possess keen insights into the minds of others and knowledge of the balance between life and death.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Half-elves who come to peace with their mixed heritages embody the stillness of mind and meditative enlightenment of the monk's way. Many learn to adopt both human and elven martial techniques into deadly new schools of combat.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Half-elves tend to live in the now, drawing oracular insights from whispers in the air, the motion of the stars, and imperceptible eddies in crowded streets, or even the ancient voices within their blood.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Whether devoted to a deity of their human parent, their elven parent, or any other they choose to adopt, half-elf paladins take up the aegis of their god with both zeal and grace. Often, among such holy orders, half-elves find a peace and camaraderie they're otherwise denied.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Half-elves frustrated by common society often retreat into the wild, developing a close bond with animals and the predictable changes of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Many half-elves excel at the roguish arts, studying people and their habits and by effect learning to take advantage of the proud or careless.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Magic runs in the blood of every half-elf, often manifesting as arcane or fey bloodlines, though other fonts of sorcerous power often arise. Regardless of their magic's sources, half-elves quickly master their inherited boons.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Some half-elves have a curious fascination with the idea of molding and shaping life, mind, body, and soul. Many even seek to create their eidolons as idealized beings, whether as creatures of uncanny beauty or mind-numbing terror.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Whether out of bitterness or lust for greater magical power, half-elves find themselves just as adept at wielding the power of witches as other forms of magic. Many adopt wounded or otherwise distinctive familiars, often creatures considered outcasts in their own rights.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Many half-elves inherit magical talents from their lineage, finding both solace and respect in the mastery of the arcane. While all schools of magic stand open to them, many gravitate toward spells of explosive power, those that cloak them in mystery, or that otherwise aid in manipulating the world around them.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits-3">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits replace existing half-elf racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Ancestral Arms</strong>: Some half-elves receive training in an unusual weapon. Half-elves with this racial trait receive <a href="../feats.html#_exotic-weapon-proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</a> or <a href="../feats.html#_martial-weapon-proficiency">Martial Weapon Proficiency</a> with one weapon as a bonus feat at 1st level. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Training</strong>: Half-elves occasionally seek tutoring to help them master the magic in their blood. Half-elves with this racial trait have only one favored class and it must be an arcane spellcasting class. They can use spell trigger and spell completion items for their favored class as if 1 level higher (or as a 1st-level character if they have no levels in that class). This racial trait replaces the multitalented racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Minded</strong>: The mixed ancestry of some half-elves makes them resistant to mental attacks. Half-elves with this racial trait get a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated</strong>: Many half-elves are skilled in the art of ingratiating themselves into a community as if they were natives. Half-elves with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise">Disguise</a>, and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) checks. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Sociable</strong>: Half-elves are skilled at charming others and recovering from faux pas. If half-elves with this racial trait attempt to change a creature's attitude with a <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Water Child</strong>: Some half-elves are born of elves adapted to life on or near the water. These half-elves gain a +4 racial bonus on <a href="../skills/swim.html#_swim">Swim</a> checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language. This racial trait replaces the half-elf's adaptability and multitalented racial traits.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options-3">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever she gains a level in a favored class, half-elves have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class. The following options are available to all half-elves who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Add 1 to the half-elf's total number of bardic performance rounds per day.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Select one cleric domain power at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the druid's Wisdom modifier. The druid adds 1/2 to the number of uses per day of that domain power. For half-elf druids whose nature bond gives them an animal companion, add +1 skill rank to the animal companion. If the half-elf ever replaces her animal companion, the new companion gains these bonus skill ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Add +1 to the fighter's CMD when resisting a disarm or overrun.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Add +1 skill rank to the ranger's animal companion. If the half-elf ever replaces his companion, the new companion gains these bonus skill ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> checks to feint and <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks to gather information.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Add +1/4 to the eidolon's evolution pool.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Add one spell from the witch spell list to the witch's familiar. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level she can cast. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, the new familiar knows these bonus spells.</p>
<h2 id="half-orcs">Half-Orcs</h2>
<p>Half-orcs often exist at the social margins. Bestial in appearance and traditionally feared by those non-orcs they encounter, half-orcs tend to be tenacious and driven to prove themselves. Some hope to show that they are different from their brutish orc kin, struggling to find the better angels of their nature, while others embrace their monstrous heritage to become terrifying exemplars of ferocity in combat. One way or another, almost all half-orcs crave respect—whether it's given freely or must be taken by force.</p>
<p>Derided as mongrels by humans and weaklings by orcs, half-orcs have bitterness beaten into them from birth, as well as the burning will to endure and overcome. With their physical size and strength, half-orcs represent raw and primal power, yet whether that power gets used for good or evil depends entirely on the individual.</p>
<h3 id="half-orc-adventurers">Half-Orc Adventurers</h3>
<p>Due to their powerful builds, half-orcs are particularly suited to the martial classes, whether as axe-wielding barbarians, battle-scarred soldiers, or cold-eyed assassins, and even those of the magical classes are generally no stranger to bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: While half-orcs raised by their monstrous kin are rarely studious, a surprising number take up the discipline of alchemy, relishing the destructive potential of its bombs, poisons, and mutagens.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Half-orc barbarians are legendary champions, unstoppable combat engines that cement the fell reputation of their kind throughout the world (for better or worse). Their hunger for battle and ability to tap into the bestial fury of their orc heritage are all that is needed to earn them a place in most adventuring parties.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Half-orcs trying to overcome racial prejudice among the civilized races sometimes pursue performance, diplomacy, and learning as a means to uplift not only their own genteel disposition but also the reputation of other half-orcs in the community and society.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: While half-orcs often face prejudice when it comes to being accepted into human noble houses and the knightly orders of cavaliers, their physical stature and aptitude in combat sometimes force those who would deny them entrance to reconsider their views. In orc society, cavaliers frequently act as standard bearers for warlords.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Half-orc clerics are often the spiritual leaders of their communities, bridging the gap between the living and the dead and as ready to mete out divine judgment and conquest as to nurture and heal.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Half-orc druids often see the natural world as a source of feral power, tapping into the destructive force of storms and predators. Many of them take up druidism as outcasts from humanoid society, finding peace and acceptance among the beasts of the field.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Many orcs are singled out for martial training because of their intimidating size and appearance. While many other races assume all half-orc combatants employ the barbarian's howling charge, in fact many prefer the discipline, precision, and versatility of the fighter's studied warcraft.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Already intimidating to many races, half-orcs make natural inquisitors, acting as bodyguards, criminal organizers and enforcers, and monster-hunters (sometimes even acting against their orc kin).</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Most half-orc monks learn their abilities from humans, as such discipline is rare in orc society. Some seek to overcome their bestial natures with perfect balance and control, others merely to break foes with their bare hands.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Creatures of mystery and omen, half-orc oracles are often imposing prophets of doom and destruction, drawing upon the spirits of the dead, the power of war, or the more violent elements of fire and storm.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: While some races laugh at the idea of a half-orc paladin, in fact it's not uncommon for half-orcs devoted to a lawful good deity to become champions of the cause, seeking to redeem themselves in society's eyes through great personal valor.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Often forced to live on the fringes of society and fend for themselves, half-orcs make excellent hunters and scouts, sometimes protecting the very communities that have rejected them in the hope of finding acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Marginalized by society, half-orcs are often forced to sneak and steal to survive, and some find that the lifestyle suits them, becoming bandits, burglars, enforcers, and cutthroats.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: While wizardry is rare among orc society, sorcery has a brutal simplicity that orcs can understand and appreciate, making half-orc sorcerers prized (and feared) for their abilities in both orc and human society.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Half-orcs are often outcasts, and hence many gravitate toward the summoner class as a chance to construct beings of perfect loyalty and friendship. Especially in orc lands, half-orc summoners tend to create eidolons that are as large and menacing as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Orc society is inherently superstitious, and many half-orcs inherit this trait. Half-orc witches in human society sometimes use their bestial features to enhance their air of intimidating otherness. Even more than other witches, half-orc witches find themselves generally regarded with fear and distrust by those who would seek their power, and many take to the road in pursuit of their own mysterious ends.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: While wizard are extremely rare in orc society, as their culture has little access to or interest in books and arcane study, half-orc wizards are sometimes found in human societies, studying hard in a pursuit of power that could help win them the respect and position they so desperately desire.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits-4">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits replace existing half-orc racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Beastmaster</strong>: Some half-orcs have a spiritual kinship with fantastical beasts, capturing them for sport or living and hunting with them. A half-orc with this trait treats whip and net as martial weapons and gains a +2 bonus on <a href="../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> checks. This racial trait replaces the orc ferocity racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Bestial</strong>: The orc blood of some half-orcs manifests in the form of particularly prominent orc features, exacerbating their bestial appearances but improving their already keen senses. They gain a +2 racial bonus on <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks. This racial trait replaces the orc ferocity racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Cavewight</strong>: Some half-orcs live far from the surface, seeking solace in winding cave complexes. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) and <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks made underground. This racial trait replaces the intimidating racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Chain Fighter</strong>: Some half-orcs have escaped from slavery and reforged the chains of their imprisonment into deadly weapons. Half-orcs with this racial trait are proficient with flails and heavy flails, and treat dire flails and spiked chains as martial weapons. This trait replaces the weapon familiarity racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Gatecrasher</strong>: Many half-orcs revel in acts of wanton destruction. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on Strength checks to break objects and a +2 bonus on sunder attempts. This racial trait replaces the orc ferocity racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Plagueborn</strong>: Half-orcs are sometimes forced to live on the rancid and unsanitary margins of society, becoming inured to all manner of sickness. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease, ingested poisons, and becoming nauseated or sickened. This racial trait replaces the intimidating and orc ferocity racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Rock Climber</strong>: Half-orcs from mountainous regions are excellent climbers, and sometimes ambush prey by leaping down from above. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> checks. This racial trait replaces the intimidating trait.</p>
<p><strong>Sacred Tattoo</strong>: Tattoos, piercings, and ritual scarification are sacred markings to many half-orcs. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. This racial trait replaces the orc ferocity racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Scavenger</strong>: Some half-orcs eke out a leaving picking over the garbage heaps of society, and must learn to separate rare finds from the inevitable dross. Half-orcs with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on <a href="../skills/appraise.html#_appraise">Appraise</a> checks and on <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine if food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste. This racial trait replaces the intimidating racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Toothy</strong>: Some half-orcs' vestigial tusks are massive and sharp, granting a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage. This racial trait replaces the orc ferocity racial trait.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options-4">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, half-orcs have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.</p>
<p>The following options are available to all half-orcs who have the listed favored class.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Add +1/2 to bomb damage.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Add 1 to the half-orc's total number of rage rounds per day.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Add +2 on rolls to stabilize when dying.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Add +1/2 on <a href="../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> checks to identify creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Add +1 hit point to the ranger's animal companion. If the half-orc ever replaces his animal companion, the new animal companion gains these bonus hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Add +1/2 to fire spell damage.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Add 1 skill rank to the witch's familiar. If the half-orc ever replaces her familiar, the new familiar gains these bonus skill ranks.</p>
<h2 id="halflings">Halflings</h2>
<p>Often overlooked due to their diminutive size, halflings have an amazing ability to seamlessly insert themselves into the grand narrative of the world around them. Quick, deft, and strong-willed, they blend into the societies of other races and quickly make themselves indispensable. Though sometimes stereotyped as sneaks and thieves by other races—and with plenty of examples to back up the allegations—halflings as a rule are neither. Rather, most halflings are adaptable and easy-going, and though their curiosity sometimes gets them into trouble, most gnomes meet adversity with a tenacity and courage that belies their small stature.</p>
<p>Halflings rarely live in segregated communities, but their cultural kinship with other halflings (and to a lesser extent with gnomes) is an unspoken connection between those who know what it is to be so small and ignored in a world full of bigger creatures.</p>
<h3 id="halfling-adventurers">Halfling Adventurers</h3>
<p>Halflings who choose to become adventurers often favor light armor and weapons that play to their natural dexterity, emphasizing a variety of skills to be ready for any occasion. Though rarely looking for a fight, their insatiable curiosity often leads them to wander far and wide—and sometimes straight into danger.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Halflings' natural curiosity leads them to experimentation, and few classes reinforce this tendency so much as that of the alchemist, where new and ever-more incendiary (sometimes literally) discoveries are always just around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Though larger races may laugh at the idea of a halfling barbarian, few do so to his face. Though weaker than many other barbarians, the sheer fury of a raging halfling can catch many opponents off guard.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Halflings love to sing, dance, and celebrate, and their bards are masterful entertainers with the common touch. Though sometimes employed in high halls and grand theaters, halfling bards are even more likely to be found engaging their wanderlust on the road, bringing mirth and merriment to new audiences every day.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Halflings may be too small to effectively master horsemanship, but astride a pony, riding dog, or more exotic mount, a halfling cavalier can turn the japes of larger rivals on their heads, leading soldiers into battle with complete fearlessness and inspiring great heroics with their skill and dedication.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Halflings have an enduring faithfulness in one another, and this devotion carries over to their gods. Their good humor, curiosity, and ability to blend into new societies with ease make them natural missionaries.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Though halflings tend to appreciate the finer points of civilization, some halfling druids find solace and enlightenment in the wilds, and others ally themselves with the animals already present in cities.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Halflings are often less bloodthirsty than other races, yet they still understand and appreciate the value of a trained warrior capable of defending her kin.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: With their ability to blend in with the scenery and eavesdrop without being noticed, halflings pick up clandestine information quite easily, and this combined with their curiosity makes them perfect inquisitors, especially suited to investigating other races.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Many halflings seek the simple life of devotion and dedication that is the monk's path. With their placid and seemingly harmless appearance and their dedication to hard work, monks blend seamlessly into halfling communities, though many a raider has learned his error after attacking an unarmed halfling.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Though oracles are rare among most races, in places where halflings are oppressed or enslaved, oracles become more common, acting as the secret spiritual centers of a community when open worship or organization is forbidden. Halfling oracles often venerate the spirits of earth, nature, or even heroes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Given the high value they place on community, hearth, and home, many halflings aspire to be paladins. Enemies who do not take them seriously soon learn their error as these stout crusaders unleash the fury of heaven upon those of evil motives.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Halflings may not be renowned for hunting, but only because their great skill is overlooked by those unable to overcome their prejudices. Halfling rangers are experts at bringing down game both large and small, blending into the wilds as easily as their brethren blend into the cityscape, or using their tactical acumen in conjunction with their trusted animal companions (who sometimes act as their steeds as well).</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Rogues are stereotypical halfling adventurers, making their way as jocular raconteurs, cunning burglars, and daring highwaymen. With their light step and deft hands, halflings make natural thieves and pickpockets, a fact not overlooked by their detractors.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Halfling sorcerers often keep their magical abilities concealed until they're needed, the better to catch their opponents off-guard, and often favor charms to enhance their natural persuasiveness or massive evocations that make their small size seem irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Halflings are endlessly curious, and some seek the path of the summoner to explore the myriad possible forms that magical life can take. Their eidolons are generally flamboyant in their color, with appearances as wild as their summoners' imaginations, and sometimes used as mounts.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: Though halflings have a reputation for wide-eyed naiveté, they also tend to collect secrets, and some follow this route to the superstitious calling of the witch, becoming wise women, herbalists, and crazed knowledge-seekers.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Halfling wizards often seek their arcane secrets out of a combination of curiosity and a desire to rise above their physical size and force other races to take notice of them. As a result, they tend to prefer flashy spells and flagrant displays of power.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits-5">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits replace existing halfling racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Craven</strong>: While most halflings are fearless, some are skittish, making them particularly alert. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on attack rolls when flanking. They suffer a –2 penalty on fear saves and gain no benefit from morale bonuses on fear saves. When affected by a fear effect, their base speed increases by 10 feet and they gain a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class. This racial trait replaces the fearless and halfling luck racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Low Blow</strong>: Some halflings train extensively in how to attack larger creatures. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on critical confirmation rolls against opponents larger than themselves. This racial trait replaces the keen senses racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Outrider</strong>: Some halflings specialize in mounted combat. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on <a href="../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> and <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> checks. This racial trait replaces the sure-footed racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Practicality</strong>: Halflings are grounded in hard work and common sense. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any one <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> or <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> skill, as well as on <a href="../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks and saves against illusions. This racial trait replaces the fearless and sure-footed racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Swift as Shadows</strong>: Halflings possess incredible stealth even while moving through obstructed areas. Halflings with this racial trait reduce the penalty for using <a href="../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a> while moving by 5, and reduce the <a href="../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a> check penalty for sniping by 10. This racial trait replaces the sure-footed racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Underfoot</strong>: Halflings must train hard to effectively fight bigger opponents. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against foes larger than themselves and a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws to avoid trample attacks. This racial trait replaces the halfling luck racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Wanderlust</strong>: Halflings love travel and maps. Halflings with this racial trait receive a +2 bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) and <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks. When casting spells or using abilities that provide or enhance movement, halflings treat their caster level as +1 higher than normal. This racial trait replaces the fearless and halfling luck racial traits.</p>
<p><strong>Warslinger</strong>: Halflings are experts at the use of the sling. Halflings with this racial trait can reload a sling as a free action. Reloading a sling still requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. This racial trait replaces the sure-footed racial trait.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options-5">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, halflings have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.</p>
<p>The following options are available to all halflings who have the listed favored class.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Add +1/2 on <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> checks to pass secret messages, +1/2 on <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks to gather information, and +1/2 on <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise">Disguise</a> checks to appear as an elven, half-elven, or human child.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Select one domain power granted at 1st level that is normally usable for a number of times per day equal to 3 + the cleric's Wisdom modifier. The cleric adds 1/2 to the number of uses per day of that domain power.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Add +1 to the fighter's CMD when resisting a grapple or trip.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Add +1 to the monk's CMD when resisting a grapple and +1/2 to the number of stunning attacks he can attempt per day.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Add +1/2 hp to the paladin's lay on hands ability (whether using it to heal or harm).</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Add +1/3 dodge bonus to Armor Class against the halfling's favored enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Choose a weapon from the following list: sling, dagger, or any weapon with “halfling” in its name. Add a +1/2 circumstance bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls with that weapon (maximum bonus of +4). This bonus does not stack with <a href="../feats.html#_critical-focus">Critical Focus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Add +1 skill rank to the summoner's eidolon.</p>
<h2 id="humans">Humans</h2>
<p>Humans possess an adaptability and expansionist verve, driven by endless fonts of ambition and imagination. Such traits have allowed them to spread across the face of the world, acclimating to an endless variety of lands and conquering each new frontier. While often perceived as aggressive and destructive by farther-sighted races, most humans seek merely to use what time they're given to live their lives to the fullest. Able negotiators and adaptors, even those peoples who fall beneath humanity's endless march are often assimilated, becoming new resources fueling the race's endless cultural adventurism.</p>
<p>Humans demonstrate immense diversity in their physical appearance, with skin ranging from dusky hues to milky pallor, and hair running the gamut from flaxen to ebon. Where they might be found also varies widely, settlers and ambitious human explorers finding their ways into the hearts of the most barren deserts, to the frigid coasts of icy seas, even into the sweltering depths of the earth, all seemingly united in an impossible, endless quest to chart what lies over the next horizon. Human diversity extends to every field of study as well, as their curiosity leads them to unlimited opportunities, endlessly striving for mastery.</p>
<h3 id="human-adventurers">Human Adventurers</h3>
<p>Human adventurers specialize in every career, their talent and ambition driving them not just to succeed but to achieve greatness, founding legacies to endure long past their short lifespans.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Sometimes dismissed as eccentrics and dabblers in dangerous arts, the practical skills of human alchemists always find them employment, if often at a safe distance from their employers.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: From steaming jungles to the desolate steppes, barbarians shun “civilized” society, winning esteem by their toughness, steely confidence, and indomitable prowess. Even in savagery the race's inventiveness shines through, leading human barbarians to often create and master a variety of crude but deadly weapons and fighting styles.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Human bards show little inhibition but great artistic range. They often prove intensely curious, collecting stories and histories, building their personal legends while they retell the tales of others.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: Humans form the backbone of many cavalier orders, balancing an aristocratic gentility with dedication to serving their liege and the chivalric ideal, earning the esteem of commoners and nobility alike.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric</strong>: Humans readily believe in ideals larger than themselves and flock to religions great and small. Humans often form personal connections with deities, embodying traits and forces they idealize.</p>
<p><strong>Druid</strong>: Druidism is regarded by many humans as an “old faith,” eternal and as all-encompassing as the world itself. Though some dismiss them as backward hermits standing in the way of progress, druids often garner a measure of both wary respect and suspicious fear.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: Human fighters run the gamut of professions—from wanderers and soldiers to swashbucklers and brawlers—but are never people to be trifled with.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: While capable of faith and trust, humans are equally susceptible to paranoia and suspicion, and entire orders of mostly human inquisitors have earned fame (or infamy) through their purges of dangerous creatures and tenacious witch hunts.</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Craving peace and the discipline of perfection, human monks often stand apart from society. While many admire monks, only the most dedicated possess the clarity and self-control to master their ways.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong>: Human oracles employ a variety of cultic arts to reveal the essence and outlook of the oracle. What agents these seers might employ in their strange arts varies mildly, often reflecting mysterious truths.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong>: Humans aspiring to heroic ideals, seeking noble ways to defend their people, or merely aspiring to lofty ideas of honor and heroism, often gravitate to the paladin class. Though a difficult and often self-sacrificing road, human paladins charge to the forefront of nearly any crusade against the forces of evil.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Humans challenge themselves to best every kind of prey, leading many to become skilled hunters and trackers of beasts and even deadlier quarries. Over time, many human rangers come to prefer the company of animals to that of people.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue</strong>: Ambitious, sometimes to a fault, human rogues defy all barriers to gain what they desire. Whether as unscrupulous assassins or dashing thieves, few can resist the deceptions and charms of such determined scoundrels.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: With a long history of commingled bloodlines, humans frequently display latent arcane power. Sometimes denounced as freaks or praised as marvels, sorcerers must rely on their inner strength to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Summoner</strong>: Shaping life and commanding terrors with their every word, human summoners embrace the powers of creation. Eidolons under their command might take a vast variety of shapes, typically being manifestations of their masters' deepest hopes or darkest nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>Witch</strong>: The human lust for mastery over the world sometimes leads down mysterious and potentially dangerous routes, such as that of the reclusive witch.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard</strong>: Many humans seek power, knowledge, and insights into the secrets of creation, leading human wizards to seek out ancient mysteries of arcane lore and new magical innovations. Humans excel both at mastering specific schools of magic and in more universal studies.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-racial-traits-6">Alternate Racial Traits</h3>
<p>The following racial traits replace existing human racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>
<p><strong>Eye for Talent</strong>: Humans have great intuition for hidden potential. They gain a +2 bonus on <a href="../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks. In addition, when they acquire an animal companion, bonded mount, cohort, or familiar, that creature gains a +2 bonus to one ability score of the character's choice. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Heart of the Fields</strong>: Humans born in rural areas are used to hard labor. They gain a bonus equal to half their character level to any one <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> or <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> skill, and once per day they may ignore an effect that would cause them to become fatigued or exhausted. This racial trait replaces the skilled racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Heart of the Streets</strong>: Humans from bustling cities are skilled with crowds. They gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class when adjacent to at least two other allies. Crowds do not count as difficult terrain for them. This racial trait replaces the skilled racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Heart of the Wilderness</strong>: Humans raised in the wild learn the hard way that only the strong survive. They gain a bonus equal to half their character level on <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks. They also gain a +5 bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying and add half their character level to their Constitution score when determining the negative hit point total necessary to kill them. This racial trait replaces the skilled racial trait.</p>
<h3 id="favored-class-options-6">Favored Class Options</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, humans have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class. The following options are available to all humans who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>

<h1 id="base-classes">Base Classes</h1>
<p>While most common folk have shared ale with a fighter or perhaps even seen a wizard perform an awesome act of magic, these are not the only adventurers known to legends and history. The following character classes present new options for players and greater variety for a Game Master's cast of nonplayer characters.</p>
<h2 id="base-classes-1">Base Classes</h2>
<p>The six new base classes presented in this book are equivalent in power to the 11 core classes in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>. Game Masters (also called GMs) are encouraged to allow players to choose freely from these classes and the other additional rules and options in this book, but each GM must make a personal decision about what is and isn't allowed in his campaign, and the relative prevalence of such character classes in his or her world.</p>
<p>Each new class presents interesting character themes and special abilities as follows.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#alchemist">Alchemist</a></strong>: The alchemist is the master of alchemy, using extracts to grant him great power, mutagens to enhance his form, and bombs to destroy his enemies.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#cavalier">Cavalier</a></strong>: Mounted upon his mighty steed, the cavalier is a brave warrior, using his wit, charm, and strength at arms to rally his companions and achieve his goals.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#inquisitor">Inquisitor</a></strong>: Scourge of the unfaithful and hunter of horrors, the inquisitor roots out the enemies of her faith with grim conviction and an array of divine blessings.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#oracle">Oracle</a></strong>: Drawing upon divine mysteries, the oracle channels divine power through her body and soul, but at a terrible price.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#summoner">Summoner</a></strong>: Bonded to a mysterious creature called an eidolon, the summoner focuses his power on strengthing that connection and enhancing his strange, otherworldy companion.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#witch">Witch</a></strong>: Lurking on the fringe of civilization, the witch makes a powerful connection with a patron that grants her strange and mysterious powers through a special familiar.</p>

<h2 id="alchemist">Alchemist</h2>
<p>Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: The alchemist's reputation is not softened by his exuberance (some would say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting his magical extracts and potion-like creations, infusing these substances with magic siphoned from his aura and using his own body as experimental stock. Nor is it mollified by the alchemist's almost gleeful passion for building explosive bombs and discovering strange new poisons and methods for their use. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for most civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem to fit quite well with most adventuring groups.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>

<h3 id="class-features">Class Features</h3>
<p>The following are class features of the alchemist.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Alchemists are proficient with all simple weapons and bombs. They are also proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemy (Su)</strong>: Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane alchemical substances such as alchemist's fire and smokesticks, but also of fashioning magical potion-like extracts in which they can store spell effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power-this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the effects to the creator.</p>
<p>When using <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist can use <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) to identify potions as if using <em><a href="#detect-magic">detect magic</a></em>. He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.</p>
<p>An alchemist can create three special types of magical items-extracts, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities-both of these are detailed in their own sections below.</p>
<p>Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like <em><a href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>using the alchemist's level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though, extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a potion normally could not.</p>
<p>An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table 2–1. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
<p>When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping-an alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use (but see the “infusion” discovery below). An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work-most alchemists prepare many extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but it's not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so that he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.</p>
<p>Although the alchemist doesn't actually cast spells, he does have a formulae list that determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formuale list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses <a href="#use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a> to do so). An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a potion-the effects of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist. An alchemist can draw and drink an extract as a standard action. The alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level.</p>
<p>Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificant-comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement).</p>
<p>An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an alchemist's extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard's spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.</p>
<p><strong>Bomb (Su)</strong>: In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert-their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day-once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.</p>
<p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the <a href="#throw-splash-weapon">Throw Splash Weapon</a> special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as <a href="#point-blank-shot">Point-Blank Shot</a> and <a href="#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a>. On a direct hit, an alchemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as <a href="#vital-strike">Vital Strike</a>). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. An alchemist's bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#brew-potion">Brew Potion</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, alchemists receive <a href="#brew-potion">Brew Potion</a> as a bonus feat. An alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as his caster level. The spell must be one that can be made into a potion. The alchemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.</p>
<p><strong>Mutagen (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time-if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.</p>
<p>When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score-either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma.</p>
<p>A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier) or become nauseated for 1 hour-a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#throw-anything">Throw Anything</a> (Ex)</strong>: All alchemists gain the <a href="#throw-anything">Throw Anything</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. An alchemist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Acid bomb*</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.</p>
<p><em>Combine extracts</em>: When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Concentrate poison</em>: The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.</p>
<p><em>Concussive bomb*</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Delayed bomb</em>: The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. <em><a href="#dispel-magic">Dispel magic</a></em> can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Dilution</em>: Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Dispelling Bomb</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted <em><a href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Elixir of life</em>: Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell <em><a href="#true-resurrection">true resurrection</a></em>. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a <em><a href="#resurrection">resurrection</a></em> spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Enhance potion</em>: A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.</p>
<p><em>Eternal potion</em>: If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the extend potion discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Explosive bomb*</em>: The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.</p>
<p><em>Extend potion</em>: A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration. This does not apply to extracts.</p>
<p><em>Fast bombs</em>: An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Feral mutagen</em>: Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> skill checks.</p>
<p><em>Force bomb*</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Frost bomb*</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.</p>
<p><em>Grand mutagen</em>: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen). An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the greater mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Greater mutagen</em>: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Infuse mutagen</em>: When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens-only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.</p>
<p><em>Inferno bomb*</em>: The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of <em><a href="#incendiary-cloud">incendiary cloud</a></em> instead of <em><a href="">fog cloud</a>,</em>filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Infusion</em>: When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.</p>
<p><em>Madness bomb</em>: The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh-they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Poison bomb*</em>: The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of <em><a href="#cloudkill">cloudkill</a></em> instead of <em><a href="">fog cloud</a></em>, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Precise bombs</em>: Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.</p>
<p><em>Shock bomb*</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><em>Smoke bomb*</em>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as <em><a href="">fog cloud</a></em>, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.</p>
<p><em>Sticky bomb</em>: The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Sticky poison</em>: Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky-when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><em>Stink bomb*</em>: The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of <em><a href="#stinking-cloud">stinking cloud</a></em> instead of <em><a href="">fog cloud</a></em>, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Poison Resistance (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
<p><strong>Poison Use (Ex)</strong>: Alchemists are trained in the use of poison and starting at 2nd level, cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Alchemy (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an alchemist can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an alchemist half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items, and he can apply poison to a weapon as a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Poisoning (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, an alchemist can apply a dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Mutagen (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, the effects of a mutagen last for 1 hour per level.</p>
<p><strong>Instant Alchemy (Ex)</strong>: At 18th level, an alchemist can create alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a full-round action if he succeeds at the <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation. He can apply poison to a weapon as an immediate action.</p>
<p><strong>Grand Discovery (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, the alchemist makes a grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third discovery chosen from the list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.</p>
<p><em>Awakened Intellect</em>: The alchemist's constant exposure to strange chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score permanently increases by 2 points.</p>
<p><em>Eternal Youth</em>: The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical ability scores from advanced age. If the alchemist is already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.</p>
<p><em>Fast Healing</em>: The alchemist's flesh responds to damage with shocking speed-he gains fast healing 5.</p>
<p><em>Philosopher's Stone</em>: The alchemist learns how to create a <a href="#philosopher-s-stone"><em>philosopher's stone</em></a>, and can do so once per month at no cost. Creating a <em>philosopher's stone</em> takes 1 day of work.</p>
<p><em>Poison Touch</em>: The alchemist gains a poisonous touch, as if under the effects of a <em><a href="#poison">poison</a></em> spell. He can suppress or activate this ability as a free action. The physical appearance of how the alchemist generates and delivers his poisonous touch varies from alchemist to alchemist.</p>
<p><em>True Mutagen</em>: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +8 natural armor bonus and a +8 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen). An alchemist must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>

<h2 id="cavalier">Cavalier</h2>
<p>While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The cavalier's true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social situations.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: d10.</p>

<h3 id="class-features-1">Class Features</h3>
<p>The following are the class features of the cavalier.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Cavaliers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Challenge (Ex)</strong>: Once per day, a cavalier can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The cavalier's melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier's level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
<p>Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier's concentration. The cavalier takes a –2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of his challenge.</p>
<p>The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Each cavalier's challenge also includes another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier's order.</p>
<p><strong>Mount (Ex)</strong>: A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the cavalier's level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium cavalier can select a camel or a horse. A Small cavalier can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.</p>
<p>A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on <a href="#ride">Ride</a> checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A cavalier's mount does not gain the share spells special ability.</p>
<p>A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a cavalier's mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.</p>
<p><strong>Order (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.</p>
<p>A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.</p>
<p><strong>Tactician (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier's Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted.</p>
<p><strong>Expert Trainer (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.</p>
<p><strong>Banner (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter, a cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The cavalier must meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Tactician (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Using the tactician ability is a swift action.</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Demanding Challenge (Ex)</strong>: At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a –2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Banner (Ex)</strong>: At 14th level, the cavalier's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.</p>
<p><strong>Master Tactician (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the cavalier's base attack bonus.</p>

He can use this ability once each time he takes damage. This ability cannot be used to convert ability damage, ability drain, or energy damage to nonlethal damage. At 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, the amount of damage the cavalier can convert increases by 1.</p>
<p><em>Stem the Tide (Ex)</em>: At 8th level, the cavalier receives <a href="#stand-still">Stand Still</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. Instead of making a combat maneuver check to stop the creature from moving, a cavalier with this ability can elect to make a normal attack instead. If the attack hits and deals damage, the target must stop moving, just as if the cavalier had made a successful combat maneuver check.</p>
<p><em>Protect the Meek (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, the cavalier can move to intercept foes. As an immediate action, he can move up to his speed (or his mount's speed, if mounted) and make a single melee attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Whenever an order of the star cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all his saving throws as long as he is threatening the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: An order of the star cavalier adds <a href="#heal">Heal</a> (Wis) and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the star cavalier can make <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) skill checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the check involves his chosen faith.</p>
<p><strong>Order Abilities</strong>: An order of the star cavalier gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>
<p><em>Calling (Ex)</em>: At 2nd level, the cavalier can make a short prayer as a standard action, filling him with confidence in his abilities. At any point in the next minute, he can receive a competence bonus on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check equal to his Charisma modifier. He must declare that he is using this bonus before the roll is made. He can use this ability up to four times per day, once for each type of check or roll. In addition, the cavalier adds 1/2 his cavalier level to any levels of paladin or cleric he might possess for the purposes of determining the effects of channel energy or lay on hands.</p>
<p><em>For the Faith (Ex)</em>: At 8th level, the cavalier can call upon his faith to bolster himself in combat. As a free action, the cavalier can call out the name of his deity, granting him a morale bonus on attack rolls equal to his Charisma modifier for 1 round. In addition, any allies within 30 feet that share his faith also receive half this bonus (minimum +1). The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Retribution (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, the cavalier can take retribution on those who dare to strike an agent of his faith. Whenever an enemy makes a successful melee attack against the cavalier or an adjacent ally devoted to the same faith as the cavalier, the enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier receives a +2 morale bonus on the attack of opportunity. If the attack made by the enemy was a critical hit, the cavalier may treat the enemy as the target of his challenge for the attack of opportunity. The cavalier can use this ability once per round.</p>
<h4 id="order-of-the-sword">Order of the Sword</h4>
<p>Cavaliers who join the order of the sword dedicate their lives to the code of chivalry, living a life of honor, valor, and fairness. Cavaliers of this order tend to swear service to a lord or a lady. Of all the orders, the order of the sword is perhaps the broadest in terms of its focus and ideals.</p>
<p><strong>Edicts</strong>: The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger, mercy to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and the meek. He must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Whenever an order of the sword cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge so long as he is astride his mount. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: An order of the sword cavalier adds <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nobility) (Int) and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> to oppose a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> check, he receives a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>
<p><strong>Order Abilities</strong>: An order of the sword cavalier receives the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>
<p><em>By My Honor (Ex)</em>: At 2nd level, the cavalier must select one alignment. As long as he maintains the selected alignment, he receives a +2 morale bonus to one saving throw of his choice.</p>
<p><em>Mounted Mastery (Ex)</em>: At 8th level, the cavalier ignores the armor check penalty when using the <a href="#ride">Ride</a> skill, regardless of whether or not the creature he is riding is his mount. Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he receives a +4 dodge bonus to his AC to avoid attacks set against his charge. When making such an attack, he can add his mount's Strength modifier to the damage roll, in addition to his own. He also receives a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: <a href="#mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="#ride-by-attack">Ride-By Attack</a>, <a href="#skill-focus">Skill Focus</a> (<a href="#ride">Ride</a>), <a href="#spirited-charge">Spirited Charge</a>, <a href="#trample">Trample</a>, or <a href="#unseat">Unseat</a>. He must qualify for the feat selected.</p>
<p><em>Knight's Challenge (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, the cavalier can make a knight's challenge once per day. This functions like a normal challenge, but the cavalier adds his Charisma bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made against the target of his challenge. In addition, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the target of his knight's challenge.</p>
<h2 id="inquisitor">Inquisitor</h2>
<p>Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing down enemies and researching emerging threats. As a result, they often travel with others, if for no other reason than to mask their presence. Inquisitors work with members of their faith whenever possible, but even such allies are not above suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: An inquisitor's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: d8.</p>
<h3 id="class-skills-2">Class Skills</h3>
<p>The inquisitor's class skills are <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> (Cha), <a href="#climb">Climb</a> (Str), <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (Int), <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> (Cha), <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> (Cha), <a href="#heal">Heal</a> (Wis), <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (planes) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int), <a href="#perception">Perception</a> (Wis), <a href="#profession">Profession</a> (Wis), <a href="#ride">Ride</a> (Dex), <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> (Wis), <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> (Int), <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> (Dex), <a href="#survival">Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> (Str).</p>

</table>
<p>The following are class features of the inquisitor.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An inquisitor is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, longbow, repeating crossbow, shortbow, and the favored weapon of her deity. She is also proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: An inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor's spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>An inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–3. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1–3 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>).</p>
<p>An inquisitor's selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor's choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 2–4. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table 2–4 are fixed.)</p>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The inquisitor may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: Like a cleric's deity, an inquisitor's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, and her values. Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM's approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>
<p>Each domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor. Levels of cleric and inquisitor stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells.</p>
<p><strong>Judgment (Su)</strong>: Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can pronounce judgment upon her foes as a swift action. Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.</p>
<p>At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.</p>
<p>When the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
<p><em>Destruction</em>: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Healing</em>: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Justice</em>: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.</p>
<p><em>Piercing</em>: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target's spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Protection</em>: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.</p>
<p><em>Purity</em>: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.</p>
<p><em>Resiliency</em>: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor's. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.</p>
<p><em><a href="#resistance">Resistance</a></em>: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Smiting</em>: This judgment bathes the inquisitor's weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor's weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor's weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor's alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor's weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).</p>
<p><strong>Monster Lore (Ex)</strong>: The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Orisons</strong>: Inquisitors learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2–4 under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Orisons prepared using other spell slots, such as those due to metamagic feats, are expended normally.</p>
<p><strong>Stern Gaze (Ex)</strong>: Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception and intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a morale bonus on all <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> and <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level (minimum +1).</p>
<p><strong>Cunning Initiative (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.</p>
<p><strong><em>Detect Alignment</em> (Sp)</strong>: At will, an inquisitor can use <em><a href="#detect-chaos">detect chaos</a></em>, <em><a href="#detect-evil">detect evil</a></em>, <em><a href="#detect-good">detect good</a></em>, or <em><a href="#detect-law">detect law</a></em>. She can only use one of these at any given time.</p>
<p><strong>Track (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds half her level on <a href="#survival">Survival</a> skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Solo Tactics (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor's allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Teamwork Feat</strong>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as teamwork feats. The inquisitor must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.</p>
<p>As a standard action, the inquisitor can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the inquisitor loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can only change the most recent teamwork feat gained. Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, the previous teamwork feat becomes set and cannot be changed again. An inquisitor can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Bane (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons with the <em><a href="#weapons-bane">bane</a></em> weapon special ability as a swift action. She must select one creature type when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is humanoid or outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed as a swift action. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the inquisitor's level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Discern Lies</em> (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, an inquisitor can <em><a href="#discern-lies">discern lies</a></em>, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.</p>
<p><strong>Second Judgment (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects two different judgments, instead of one. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a swift action, she can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>
<p><strong>Stalwart (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the inquisitor is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Bane (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her bane ability, the amount of bonus damage dealt by the weapon against creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit Weakness (Ex)</strong>: At 14th level, the inquisitor learns to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself. Whenever the inquisitor scores a critical hit, she ignores any damage reduction the target might have. In addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses regeneration on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round. Creatures whose regeneration always functions are immune to this ability. Finally, if the inquisitor deals energy damage to a creature with vulnerability to that energy type, she deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.</p>
<p><strong>Third Judgment (Ex)</strong>: At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects three different judgments, instead of just two. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a swift action, the inquisitor can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>
<p><strong>Slayer (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her judgment. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she must select one type of judgment. She is treated as if she were 5 levels higher for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by the judgment. Unlike other types of judgment, the one enhanced by this ability cannot be changed for the remainder of the judgment</p>
<p><strong>True Judgment (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, an inquisitor can call true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the inquisitor's true judgment ability for 24 hours. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>: An inquisitor can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="ex-inquisitors">Ex-Inquisitors</h3>
<p>An inquisitor who slips into corruption or changes to a prohibited alignment loses all spells and the judgment ability. She cannot thereafter gain levels as an inquisitor until she atones (see the <em><a href="#atonement">atonement</a></em> spell description).</p>

<h2 id="oracle">Oracle</h2>
<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: d8.</p>
<h3 id="class-skills-3">Class Skills</h3>
<p>The oracle's class skills are <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (Int), <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> (Cha), <a href="#heal">Heal</a> (Wis), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (history) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (planes) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int), <a href="#profession">Profession</a> (Wis), <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> (Wis), and <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>

<p>The following are the class features of the oracle.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the <a href="#cleric-spells">cleric spell lists</a>. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the oracle's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>).</p>
<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle's selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2–6 are fixed.</p>
<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with “cure” in the name, inflict spells include all spells with “inflict” in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
<p><strong>Mystery</strong>: Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2–6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle's Curse (Ex)</strong>: Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle's curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle's curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must choose one of the following curses.</p>
<p><em>Clouded Vision</em>: Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for you to see. You cannot see anything beyond 30 feet, but you can see as if you had darkvision. At 5th level, this distance increases to 60 feet. At 10th level, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. At 15th level, you gain blindsight out to a range of 15 feet.</p>
<p><em>Deaf</em>: You cannot hear and suffer all of the usual penalties for being deafened. You cast all of your spells as if they were modified by the <a href="#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a> feat. This does not increase their level or casting time. At 5th level, you receive a +3 competence bonus on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks that do not rely upon hearing, and the initiative penalty for being deaf is reduced to –2. At 10th level, you gain scent and you do not suffer any penalty on initiative checks due to being deaf. At 15th level, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p><em>Haunted</em>: Malevolent spirits follow you wherever you go, causing minor mishaps and strange occurrences (such as unexpected breezes, small objects moving on their own, and faint noises). Retrieving any stored item from your gear requires a standard action, unless it would normally take longer. Any item you drop lands 10 feet away from you in a random direction. Add <em><a href="#mage-hand">mage hand</a></em> and <em><a href="#ghost-sound">ghost sound</a></em> to your list of spells known. At 5th level, add <em><a href="#levitate">levitate</a></em> and <em><a href="#minor-image">minor image</a></em>to your list of spells known. At 10th level, add <em><a href="#telekinesis">telekinesis</a></em>to your list of spells known. At 15th level, add <em><a href="#reverse-gravity">reverse gravity</a></em> to your list of spells known.</p>
<p><em>Lame</em>: One of your legs is permanently wounded, reducing your base land speed by 10 feet if your base speed is 30 feet or more. If your base speed is less than 30 feet, your speed is reduced by 5 feet. Your speed is never reduced due to encumbrance. At 5th level, you are immune to the fatigued condition (but not exhaustion). At 10th level, your speed is never reduced by armor. At 15th level, you are immune to the exhausted condition.</p>
<p><em>Tongues</em>: In times of stress or unease, you speak in tongues. Pick one of the following languages: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, or Terran. Whenever you are in combat, you can only speak and understand the selected language. This does not interfere with spellcasting, but it does apply to spells that are language dependent. You gain the selected language as a bonus language. At 5th level, pick an additional language to speak in combat and add it to your list of known languages. At 10th level, you can understand any spoken language, as if under the effects of <em><a href="#tongues">tongues</a>,</em>even during combat. At 15th level, you can speak and understand any language, but your speech is still restricted during combat.</p>
<p><em>Wasting</em>: Your body is slowly rotting away. You take a –4 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks, except for <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a>. You gain a +4 competence bonus on saves made against disease. At 5th level, you are immune to the sickened condition (but not nauseated). At 10th level, you gain immunity to disease. At 15th level, you are immune to the nauseated condition.</p>
<p><strong>Orisons</strong>: Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2–6 under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation</strong>: At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle's mystery.</p>
<h3 id="mysteries">Mysteries</h3>
<p>Each oracle must choose from among the following mysteries. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these revelations is equal to 10 + 1/2 the oracle's level + the oracle's Charisma modifier. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5 of this book.</p>
<h4 id="battle">Battle</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the battle mystery adds <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a>, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (engineering), <a href="#perception">Perception</a>, and <a href="#ride">Ride</a> to her list of class skills.</p>

<p><em>Battlecry (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, you can unleash an inspiring battlecry. All allies within 100 feet who hear your cry gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +2. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Battlefield Clarity (Ex)</em>: Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever you fail a saving throw that causes you to become blind, deaf, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, or stunned, you may attempt that saving throw again, with a +4 insight bonus on the roll. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th and 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>
<p><em>Combat Healer (Su)</em>: Whenever you cast a cure spell (a spell with “cure” in its name), you can cast it as a swift action, as if using the <a href="#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a> feat, by expending two spell slots. This does not increase the level of the spell. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Iron Skin (Su)</em>: Once per day, your skin hardens and takes on the appearance of iron, granting you DR 10/adamantine.

You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>

At 11th level, you gain the Greater feat (such as <a href="#greater-trip">Greater Trip</a>) that grants you a bonus when performing that maneuver.

<p><em>War Sight (Su)</em>: Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll twice and take either result. At 7th level, you can always act in the surprise round, but if you fail to notice the ambush, you act last, regardless of your initiative result (you act in the normal order in following rounds). At 11th level, you can roll for initiative three times and take any one of the results.</p>
<p><em>Weapon Mastery (Ex)</em>: Select one weapon with which you are proficient. You gain <a href="#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> with that weapon.

You can take a full-attack action and move up to your speed as a full-round action (you can move before or after the attacks). Whenever you score a critical hit, you can ignore any DR the target might possess. You gain a +4 insight bonus to your AC for the purpose of confirming critical hits against you. When you are below 0 hit points, you do not die until your negative total is in excess of twice your Constitution score.</p>

<p><em>Spirit Walk (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can become incorporeal and invisible.

<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with a flame mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Burning Magic (Su)</em>: Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes fire damage from one of your spells, it catches on fire. This fire deals 1 point of fire damage per spell level at the beginning of the burning creature's turn. The fire lasts for 1d4 rounds, but it can be extinguished as a move action if the creature succeeds at a Reflex save (using the spell's DC). Dousing the creature with water as a standard action grants a +2 bonus on this save, while immersing the creature in water automatically extinguishes the fire. Spells that do not grant a save do not cause a creature to catch on fire.</p>

Oracles with the lame oracle curse cannot select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Fire Breath (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can unleash a 15-foot cone of flame from your mouth. This flame deals 1d4 points of fire damage per level. A Reflex save halves this damage.

<p><em>Firestorm (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can cause fire to erupt around you. You can create one 10-foot cube of fire per oracle level. These cubes can be arranged in any pattern you desire, but each cube must be adjacent to another and one must be adjacent to you. Any creature caught in these flames takes 1d6 points of fire damage per oracle level, with a Reflex save resulting in half damage. This fire lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability once per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Form of Flame (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Small fire elemental, as <em><a href="#elemental-body-i">elemental body I</a></em>.

You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p><em>Heat Aura (Su)</em>: As a swift action, you can cause waves of heat to radiate from your body. This heat deals 1d4 points of fire damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d4) to all creatures within 10 feet. A Reflex save halves the damage. In addition, your form wavers and blurs, granting you 20% concealment until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Molten Skin (Ex)</em>: You gain resist fire 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity to fire.</p>
<p><em>Touch of Flame (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of fire damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

<p><em>Wings of Fire (Su)</em>: As a swift action, you can manifest a pair of fiery wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.

<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the heavens mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Awesome Display (Su)</em>: Your phantasmagoric displays accurately model the mysteries of the night sky, dumbfounding all who behold them. Each creature affected by your illusion (pattern) spells is treated as if its total number of Hit Dice were equal to its number of Hit Dice minus your Charisma modifier (if positive).</p>
<p><em>Coat of Many Stars (Su)</em>: You conjure a coat of starry radiance that grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants you DR 5/slashing. You can use this coat for 1 hour per day per oracle level. The duration does not need to be consecutive; it can instead be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>
<p><em>Dweller in <a href="#darkness">Darkness</a> (Sp)</em>: Once per day, you cast your psyche into the void of space to attract the attention of a terrible otherworldly being. The dweller in darkness behaves in all ways as if you had cast <em><a href="#phantasmal-killer">phantasmal killer</a></em>. At 17th level, the dweller in darkness can be perceived by more than one creature, as if you had cast <em><a href="#weird">weird</a></em>. You must be at least 11th level to choose this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Guiding Star (Su)</em>: Whenever you can see the open sky at night, you can determine your precise location. When the night sky is visible to you, you may also add your Charisma modifier to your Wisdom modifier on all Wisdom-based checks. In addition, once per night while outdoors, you can cast one spell as if it were modified by the <a href="#empower-spell">Empower Spell</a>, <a href="#extend-spell">Extend Spell</a>, <a href="#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a>, or Still spell feat without increasing the spell's casting time or level.</p>
<p><em>Interstellar Void (Su)</em>: You call upon the frigid depths of outer space to bring a terrible chill to your enemies. As a standard action, one target within 30 feet is cloaked in the void and takes 1d6 points of cold damage per level. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage. At 10th level, the interstellar void is so extreme that enemies who fail their saving throw are fatigued. At 15th level, creatures who fail their save are exhausted and stunned for 1 round. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day at 10th level.</p>
<p><em>Lure of the Heavens (Su)</em>: Your connection to the skies above is so strong that your feet barely touch the ground. At 1st level, you no longer leave tracks. At 5th level, you can hover up to 6 inches above the ground or even above liquid surfaces, as if levitating. At 10th level, you gain the ability to <em><a href="">fly</a></em>, as per the spell, for a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
<p><em>Mantle of Moonlight (Su)</em>: Your innate understanding of the moon renders you immune to lycanthropy. Additionally, you may disrupt a lycanthrope's connection to the moon with a successful touch attack. This action automatically forces the lycanthrope into its humanoid form, which it must remain in for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Upon reaching 5th level, you can use this ability to force others into a <em><a href="#rage">rage</a></em>, as per the spell. Using this ability is a melee touch attack. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level plus one additional time per day for every 5 levels above 5th.</p>
<p><em>Moonlight Bridge (Su)</em>: You summon a bridge of shimmering moonlight. The 10-foot-wide span touches the ground at a point adjacent to your position. From this point it can extend in any direction for 10 feet per oracle level. The path persists until you have crossed over the bridge or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter. You may summon a moonlight bridge a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Should the bridge be attacked, treat it as a <em><a href="#wall-of-force">wall of force</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Spray of Shooting Stars (Su):</em> As a standard action, you can unleash a ball of energy that explodes in a 5-foot-radius burst dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per level. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. This attack has a range of 60 feet. You can fire one explosive ball per day, plus one additional ball per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter. You can fire more than one ball at a time, but creatures caught inside more than one simultaneous explosions only take damage once.</p>
<p><em>Star Chart (Ex)</em>: Your copious notes contain a working model of the night sky expressed in artistic scribbles and arcane mathematical formulae. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes contemplating your star chart to gain the benefit of the spell <em><a href="#commune">commune</a></em>. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon achieving 20th level, your rapport with the heavens grants you perfect harmony with the universe. You receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier. You automatically stabilize if you are below 0 hit points, are immune to fear effects, and automatically confirm all critical hits. Should you die, you are reborn 3 days later in the form of a star child, who matures over the course of 7 days (treat as the <em><a href="#reincarnate">reincarnate</a></em> spell).</p>
<h4 id="life">Life</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the life mystery adds <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a>, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature), and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <em><a href="#detect-undead">detect undead</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#restoration-lesser">lesser restoration</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a></em> (6th), <em><a href="#restoration">restoration</a></em> (8th), <em><a href="#breath-of-life">breath of life</a></em> (10th), <em><a href="#heal">heal</a></em> (12th), <em><a href="#restoration-greater">greater restoration</a></em> (14th), <em><a href="#heal-mass">mass heal</a></em> (16th), <em><a href="#true-resurrection">true resurrection</a></em> (18th).</p>
<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the life mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Channel (Su)</em>: You can channel positive energy like a cleric, using your oracle level as your effective cleric level when determining the amount of damage healed (or caused to undead) and the DC. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Combat Healer (Su)</em>: As the battle mystery revelation.</p>
<p><em>Delay Affliction (Su)</em>: Once per day as an immediate action, whenever you fail a saving throw against a disease or poison, you may ignore its effects for 1 hour per level. At 7th and 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>
<p><em>Energy Body (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can transform your body into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental. In this form, you gain the elemental subtype and give off a warm, welcoming light that increases the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. Any undead creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this damage in place of the normal damage for the attack. Once per round, if you pass through a living allied creature's square or the ally passes through your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1 per oracle level. You may use this ability to heal yourself as a move action. You choose whether or not to heal a creature when it passes through your space. You may return to your normal form as a free action. You may remain in energy body form for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level.</p>
<p><em>Enhanced Cures (Su)</em>: Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of life with this revelation may cast <em><a href="#cure-light-wounds">cure light wounds</a></em> to heal 1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.</p>
<p><em>Healing Hands (Ex)</em>: You gain a +4 bonus on <a href="#heal">Heal</a> checks. You may provide first aid to two people or treat two people for poison as a standard action (make a separate <a href="#heal">Heal</a> check for each creature). When using the <a href="#heal">Heal</a> skill to treat wounds from caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat poison, treat disease, or treat long-term care, you may treat double the normal number of people you may treat at the same time. You may provide long-term care for yourself.</p>
<p><em>Life Link (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and another creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action).</p>
<p><em>Lifesense (Su)</em>: You notice and locate living creatures within 30 feet, just as if you possessed the blindsight ability. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Safe Curing (Su)</em>: Whenever you cast a spell that cures the target of hit point damage, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for spellcasting.</p>
<p><em>Spirit Boost (Su)</em>: Whenever your healing spells heal a target up to its maximum hit points, any excess points persist for 1 round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to your oracle level).</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a perfect channel for life energy. You become immune to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce you below 1 in any ability score. You automatically make saving throws against massive damage. When you are below 0 hit points, you do not die until your negative total is in excess of twice your Constitution score.</p>
<h4 id="lore">Lore</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the lore mystery adds <a href="#appraise">Appraise</a> and all <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skills to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <em><a href="#identify">identify</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#tongues">tongues</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#locate-object">locate object</a></em>(6th), <em><a href="#legend-lore">legend lore</a></em> (8th), <em><a href="#contact-other-plane">contact other plane</a></em> (10th), <em><a href="#owl-s-wisdom-mass">mass owl's wisdom</a></em> (12th), <em><a href="#vision">vision</a></em> (14th), <em><a href="#moment-of-prescience">moment of prescience</a></em> (16th), <em><a href="#time-stop">time stop</a></em> (18th).</p>
<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the lore mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Arcane Archivist (Su)</em>: Your experience with lore-filled tomes has granted you the ability to cast arcane spells as if they were on your spell list. Once per day, you can cast a spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on your list of spells known. The spell consumes a spell slot one level higher than the level of the spell. You must have a spellbook containing the spell to cast it in this way, and the spell is erased when you complete the casting. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Automatic Writing (Su)</em>: Once per day, you can spend a full hour in uninterrupted meditation. During this period, your hands produce mysterious writing that pertains to the future. At 1st level, the prophetic writing manifests as an <em><a href="#augury">augury</a></em> spell with 90% effectiveness. At 5th level, the writing takes the form of a <em><a href="#divination">divination</a></em> with 90% effectiveness. At 8th level, the writing manifests as a casting of <em><a href="#commune">commune</a></em> with no material component required.</p>
<p><em>Brain Drain (Su)</em>: You can take a standard action to violently probe the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The target receives a Will save to negate the effect and immediately knows the source of this harmful mental prying. Those who fail this save are wracked with pain, taking 1d4 points of damage per oracle level. After successfully attacking with this ability, you may use a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to make a single <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> check using the victim's skill bonus. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in your mind for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. Treat the knowledge gained as if you used <em><a href="#detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a></em>. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th.</p>
<p><em>Focused Trance (Ex)</em>: You can enter a deep meditation, blocking out visual and auditory stimuli and allowing you to concentrate on a single problem, philosophical issue, or memory. This trance lasts 1d6 rounds, during which time you can only take move actions. During this period, you gain a bonus equal to your level on all saves against sonic effects and gaze attacks. When you come out of your trance, you may make a single Intelligence-based skill check with a +20 circumstance bonus. You may enter your focused trance a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Lore Keeper (Ex)</em>: Instead of encyclopedic knowledge, you learn most of your information through tales, songs, and poems. You may use your Charisma modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier on all <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Mental Acuity (Ex)</em>: Your explorations into the secret mysteries of the world have granted you a preternatural understanding of all things-and you just keep getting smarter. You gain a +1 inherent bonus to Intelligence upon taking this revelation and another at every third oracle level gained thereafter. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em><a href="#sidestep-(combat)">Sidestep</a> Secret (Su)</em>: Your innate understanding of the universe has granted you preternatural reflexes and the uncanny ability to step out of danger at the very last second. Add your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma instead of your Dexterity.</p>
<p><em>Spontaneous Symbology</em>: Your knowledge of the secret history of the world has unveiled the mysterious symbols that govern reality. You can cast any “symbol” spell using a spell slot of the appropriate level, even if the spell is not on your list of spells known. A symbol spell is any spell with the word “symbol” in its name. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Think On It (Ex)</em>: Once per day, the oracle of lore can re-attempt any previously failed <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> check. On this attempt, add a +10 competence bonus on the check.</p>
<p><em><a href="#whirlwind">Whirlwind</a> Lesson (Ex)</em>: You can quickly browse through a magical tome or manual, gaining its benefits with only a single 8-hour study session (rather than the usual 48 hours over a period of 6 days). At 7th level, you may allow another character to join in your study; both of you gain the full benefit of having read the book. At 15th level, you may share your whirlwind lesson with a number of characters equal to your oracle level. The benefits to you are permanent, whereas your students gain the tome or manual's benefits for a number of days equal to your Charisma modifier but then forget what they have learned.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: You gain the ability to take 20 on all <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill checks. Your understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that once per day, you can cast <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em>. This ability does not require a material component, but the <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em>cannot be used to grant ability score bonuses, nor can it be used to replicate spells with expensive material components.</p>
<h4 id="nature">Nature</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the nature mystery adds <a href="#climb">Climb</a>, <a href="#fly">Fly</a>, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature), <a href="#ride">Ride</a>, <a href="#survival">Survival</a>, and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <em><a href="#charm-animal">charm animal</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#barkskin">barkskin</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#speak-with-plants">speak with plants</a></em> (6th), <em><a href="#grove-of-respite">grove of respite*</a></em> (8th), <em><a href="#awaken">awaken</a></em> (10th), <em><a href="#stone-tell">stone tell</a></em> (12th), <em><a href="#creeping-doom">creeping doom</a></em> (14th), <em><a href="#animal-shapes">animal shapes</a></em> (16th), <em><a href="#world-wave-">world wave*</a></em> (18th).</p>
<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the nature mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Bonded <a href="#mount">Mount</a> (Su)</em>: You gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal mount. The creature must be one that you are capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium oracle can select a camel or a horse. A Small oracle can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 4th level. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using your oracle level as your effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence score of at least 6.</p>
<p><em>Erosion Touch (Su)</em>: As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per level to objects or constructs. If used against an object in another creature's possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one time per day for every three levels you possess.</p>
<p><em>Friend to the Animals (Ex)</em>: Add all <em>summon nature's ally</em> spells to your spell list. You must still select these spells using your allotment of spells known. Animals within 30 feet of you receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Life Leach (Su)</em>: You can draw life force from the bodies of enemies and channel it into yourself. As a standard action, you can drain the life essence from one living target within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per two levels you possess (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the target's current hit points + the target's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points last a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier. The target receives a Fortitude save to halve the damage (and the temporary hit points you gain). You may use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels you possess beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Natural Divination (Ex)</em>: You can read the entrails of a freshly killed animal or humanoid to gain an insight bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by observing and interpreting the flights of birds, you may apply a +10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, by charting marks in dirt or stone, or observing the behavior of sand when thrown into the wind, you gain a +4 insight bonus on one initiative check. These bonuses must be used during the next 24 hours and you must declare you are using the bonus before the check or save is made. Making a natural divination takes 10 minutes. You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus one additional time per day for every four oracle levels you have attained.</p>
<p><em>Nature's Whispers (Ex)</em>: You have become so attuned to the whispers of the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great boulders, that your surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.</p>
<p><em>Speak with Animals (Ex)</em>: Choose a specific kind of animal (eagle, fox, dog, and so on). You gain the ability to converse with that type of animal as if you were under the effects of <em>speak with animal</em>. You gain the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3 oracle levels you have attained.</p>
<p><em>Spirit of Nature (Su)</em>: When in a natural setting, whenever you are reduced to negative hit points, you automatically stabilize. At 5th level, you gain fast healing 1 for 1d4 rounds whenever you are reduced to negative hit points. At 10th level, the ability works everywhere, even in civilized or wholly artificial realms. At 15th level, you gain fast healing 3 for 1d4 rounds when reduced to negative hit points.</p>
<p><em>Transcendental Bond (Su)</em>: You become so attuned to the common spirit shared by all living things that you can use it to communicate with allies. You may communicate with your allies for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level as if using <em><a href="#telepathic-bond">telepathic bond</a></em>. You may designate a number of creatures as your ally equal to your Charisma modifier. Designating a creature is a standard action that requires a touch. At 10th level, you may use this bond to cast a touch spell on a designated ally once per day.</p>
<p><em>Undo Artifice (Sp)</em>: At 11th-level, you gain the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component parts, essentially erasing the hand of artifice and rendering the item into a pile of raw natural materials. This effect acts as the spell <em><a href="#polymorph-any-object">polymorph any object</a></em>, working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike <em><a href="#polymorph-any-object">polymorph any object</a></em>, it cannot be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect. Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp in the item's value. You may use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: At 20th level, you have discovered the intrinsic secrets of life itself, granting you incredible control over your own body. Once per day, you can surround yourself with an organic cocoon as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered helpless. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to plant, animal, or humanoid, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate (see the <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>). This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Each time the transformation is made, you are cleansed of all poisons or diseases, are restored to full hit points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a new type every time the transformation is made.</p>
<h4 id="stone">Stone</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the stone mystery adds <a href="#appraise">Appraise</a>, <a href="#climb">Climb</a>, <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a>, and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <em><a href="#magic-stone">magic stone</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#stone-call">stone call*</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#meld-into-stone">meld into stone</a></em> (6th), <em><a href="#wall-of-stone">wall of stone</a></em> (8th), <em><a href="#stoneskin">stoneskin</a></em> (10th), <em><a href="#stone-tell">stone tell</a></em> (12th), <em><a href="#statue">statue</a></em> (14th), <em><a href="#repel-metal-or-stone">repel metal or stone</a></em> (16th), <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks*</a></em> (18th).</p>
<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the stone mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Acid Skin (Ex)</em>: You gain resist acid 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity to acid.</p>
<p><em>Clobbering Strike (Ex)</em>: Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent with a spell that requires an attack roll, you may immediately attempt to trip your opponent as a swift action. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity as normal for this trip attempt. You cannot be tripped in return when using this ability.</p>
<p><em>Crystal Sight (Ex)</em>: You can see through stone, earth, or sand as easily as if it were transparent crystal. Your gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to your oracle level, or 1/12th this thickness of metal. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p><em>Earth <a href="#glide-">Glide</a> (Su)</em>: You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A <em><a href="#move-earth">move earth</a></em> spell cast on an area where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a free action. You can glide for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can bring other creatures with you when you glide, but each passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.</p>
<p><em>Mighty Pebble (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can charge and throw a pebble (or other stone of similar size) that detonates when it strikes a target as a ranged attack. The pebble has a range increment of 20 feet and has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage for every four oracle levels you possess. Any creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum 1d6). Creatures in squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or no damage if they make a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses, treat the pebble as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Rock <a href="#throwing">Throwing</a> (Ex)</em>: You are an accomplished rock thrower and have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown rocks. You can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than your own size. The range increment for a rock is 20 feet, and you can hurl it up to 5 range increments. Damage for a hurled rock is 2d4 for a Medium creature or 2d3 for a Small creature, plus 1-1/2 your Strength bonus.</p>
<p><em>Shard Explosion (Su)</em>: As a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the broken shards make the area difficult terrain until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Steelbreaker Skin (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can harden your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed. Anytime a melee or ranged weapon strikes you, the weapon takes an amount of damage equal to your oracle level. This ability does not prevent the weapon from harming you unless the damage destroys the weapon attacking you. You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 minute/level. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. At 15th level, the damage from this ability ignores up to 10 points of hardness.</p>
<p><em>Stone Stability (Ex)</em>: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground. At 5th level, you gain <a href="#improved-trip">Improved Trip</a> as a bonus feat. At 10th level, you gain <a href="#greater-trip">Greater Trip</a> as a bonus feat. You do not need to meet the prerequisites to gain these feats.</p>
<p><em>Touch of Acid (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of acid damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield deals +1d6 points of acid damage, similar to how a <em><a href="#weapons-flaming">flaming</a></em> weapon operates.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of acid and earth. You can apply any one of the following feats to any acid or earth spell without increasing the level or casting time: <a href="#enlarge-spell">Enlarge Spell</a>, <a href="#extend-spell">Extend Spell</a>, <a href="#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a>, or <a href="#still-spell">Still Spell</a>.</p>
<h4 id="waves">Waves</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the waves mystery adds <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a>, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature), and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <em><a href="#touch-of-the-sea">touch of the sea*</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#slipstream">slipstream*</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#water-breathing">water breathing</a></em>(6th), <em><a href="#wall-of-ice">wall of ice</a></em> (8th), <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser*</a></em> (10th), <em><a href="#fluid-form">fluid form*</a></em> (12th), <em><a href="#vortex">vortex*</a></em> (14th), <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle*</a></em> (16th), <em><a href="#tsunami">tsunami*</a></em> (18th).</p>
<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the waves mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Blizzard (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can create a blizzard of snow and ice. You can create one 10-foot-cube of storm per oracle level. These cubes can be arranged in any pattern you desire, but each cube must be adjacent to another and one must be adjacent to you. Any creature caught in the blizzard takes 1d4 points of cold damage per oracle level, with a Reflex save resulting in half damage. The storm lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier; the ground remains icy (+5 to <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> DCs) as long as local conditions permit. The blizzard obscures sight beyond 5 feet, providing total concealment. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. You can use this ability once per day. You must be 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Fluid Nature (Ex)</em>: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense against bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip attempts. A creature trying to confirm a critical hit against you has a –4 penalty on its confirmation roll. At 5th level, you gain <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a> as a bonus feat. You do not need to meet the prerequisite to gain this feat.</p>
<p><em>Fluid Travel (Su)</em>: You can walk on liquid as if it were a solid surface. Walking on the liquid does not harm you; you can walk on acid or even lava (as if walking on a solid temporary crust), though you would still take fire damage from being near the lava. You can move across this surface at your normal land speed. At 7th level, while this ability is in effect, you can instead go underwater, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe water. You can use this ability for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>
<p><em>Freezing Spells (Su)</em>: Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes cold damage from one of your spells, it is slowed (as the <em><a href="#slow">slow</a></em> spell) for 1 round. Spells that do not allow a save do not slow creatures. At 11th level, the duration increases to 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><em>Ice Armor (Su)</em>: You can conjure armor of ice that grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants you DR 5/piercing. In cold conditions, the armor bonus (and DR bonus) increases by 2; in very hot conditions it decreases by 2. You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>
<p><em>Icy Skin (Ex)</em>: You gain resist cold 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity to cold.</p>
<p><em>Punitive <a href="#transformation">Transformation</a> (Su)</em>: You can transform an opponent into a harmless animal as if using <em><a href="#baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a></em>. This transformation lasts 1 round per oracle level. Transforming another creature causes the first to immediately revert to normal. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Water Form (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Small water elemental, as <em><a href="#elemental-body-i">elemental body I</a></em>. At 9th level, you can assume the form of a Medium water elemental, as <em><a href="#elemental-body-ii">elemental body II</a></em>. At 11th level, you can assume the form of a Large water elemental, as <em><a href="#elemental-body-iii">elemental body III</a></em>. At 13th level, you can assume the form of a Huge water elemental, as <em><a href="#elemental-body-iv">elemental body IV</a></em>. You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 hour/level. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Water Sight (Su)</em>: You can see through fog and mist without penalty as long as there is enough light to allow you to see normal. At 7th level, you can use any calm pool of water at least 1 foot in diameter as a scrying device, as if using the <em>scry</em> spell. At 15th level, this functions like <em><a href="#scrying-greater">greater scrying</a></em>.You can use the scrying abilities for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p><em>Wintry Touch (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use the wintry touch ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield is treated as a <em><a href="#weapons-frost">frost</a></em> weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of cold and water. You can apply any one of the following feats to any cold or water spell without increasing the level or casting time: <a href="#enlarge-spell">Enlarge Spell</a>, <a href="#extend-spell">Extend Spell</a>, <a href="#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a>, or <a href="#still-spell">Still Spell</a>.</p>
<h4 id="wind">Wind</h4>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An oracle with the wind mystery adds <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a>, <a href="#fly">Fly</a>, and <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Spells</strong>: <em><a href="#alter-winds">alter winds*</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#cloak-of-winds">cloak of winds*</a></em> (6th), <em><a href="#river-of-wind">river of wind*</a></em> (8th), <em><a href="#control-winds">control winds</a></em> (10th), <em><a href="#sirocco">sirocco*</a></em>(12th), <em><a href="#control-weather">control weather</a></em> (14th), <em><a href="#whirlwind">whirlwind</a></em> (16th), <em><a href="#winds-of-vengeance">winds of vengeance*</a></em> (18th).</p>
<p><strong>Revelations</strong>: An oracle with the wind mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
<p><em>Air Barrier (Ex)</em>: You can create an invisible shell of air that grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this barrier causes incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks requiring an attack roll against you to have a 50% miss chance. You can use this barrier for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>
<p><em>Gaseous Form (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can assume <em><a href="#gaseous-form">gaseous form</a></em> (as the spell). You can remain gaseous for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can bring other creatures with you in gaseous form, but each passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.</p>
<p><em><a href="#invisibility">Invisibility</a> (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can become invisible (as per the <em><a href="#invisibility">invisibility</a></em>spell). You can remain invisible for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. Starting at 9th level, each time you activate this ability you can treat it as <em><a href="#invisibility-greater">greater invisibility</a></em>, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal<em><a href="#invisibility">invisibility</a></em> duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><em>Lightning Breath (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can breathe a 30-foot line of electricity. This line deals 1d4 points of electricity damage per oracle level. A Reflex save halves this damage. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em><a href="#spark-">Spark</a> Skin (Ex)</em>: You gain resist electricity 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level, you gain immunity to electricity.</p>
<p><em>Thunderburst (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, you can create a blast of air accompanied by a loud peal of thunder. The blast has a range of 100 feet and has a 20-foot radius, increasing by 5 feet for every 4 oracle levels after 7th. Creatures in the area take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per oracle level and are deafened for 1 hour, with a Fortitude save resulting in half damage and no deafness. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Touch of Electricity (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield is treated as a <em><a href="#weapons-shock">shock</a></em> weapon.</p>
<p><em><a href="#vortex">Vortex</a> Spells (Ex)</em>: Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent with an attack spell, the target is staggered for 1 round. At 11th level, the duration increases to 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><em>Wind Sight (Ex)</em>: You ignore penalties on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks based on wind and the first 100 feet of distance. At 7th level, as a standard action, you can see and hear into any area (as if using <em>clairaudience</em> and <em>clairvoyance</em>) within range as long as there is an unobstructed path for air to travel between you and the target area (this does not require line of effect, meaning the path can turn corners and go through spaces no smaller than 1 inch in diameter). You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p><em>Wings of Air (Su)</em>: As a swift action, you can manifest a pair of translucent, cloud-like wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. At 10th level, your speed increases to 90 feet and your maneuverability increases to perfect. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
<p><strong>Final Revelation</strong>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of air and electricity. You can apply any one of the following feats to any air or electricity spell without increasing the level or casting time: <a href="#enlarge-spell">Enlarge Spell</a>, <a href="#extend-spell">Extend Spell</a>, <a href="#silent-spell">Silent Spell</a>, or <a href="#still-spell">Still Spell</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summoner">Summoner</h2>
<p>While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning monsters from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more skilled at it than the summoner. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a close bond with one particular outsider, known as an eidolon, who gains power as the summoner becomes more proficient at his summoning. Over time, the two become linked, eventually even sharing a shard of the same soul. But this power comes with a price: the summoner's spells and abilities are limited due to his time spent enhancing the power and exploring the nature of his eidolon.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Summoners spend much of their time exploring the arcane arts alongside their eidolons. While their power comes from within, they rely heavily on their eidolon companions in dangerous situations. While a summoner and his eidolon function as individuals, their true power lies in what they can accomplish together.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>

<h3 id="class-features-3">Class Features</h3>
<p>The following are the class features of the summoner.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons. Summoners are also proficient with light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner's Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–7. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>).</p>
<p>A summoner's selection of spells is extremely limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner's choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 2–8. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 2–8 are fixed.)</p>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level summoner spell he can cast. A summoner may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
<p><strong>Cantrips</strong>: A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2–8 under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they may be cast any number of times per day. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normally.</p>
<p><strong>Eidolon</strong>: A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of his languages. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by <em><a href="#protection-from-evil">protection from evil</a></em> and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of <em><a href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>, but spells such as <em><a href="#dismissal">dismissal</a></em>and <em><a href="#banishment">banishment</a></em> work normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The eidolon's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner's class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon receives a pool of evolution points, based on the summoner's class level, that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
<p>The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner's forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as <em><a href="#alter-self">alter self</a></em> or <em><a href="#polymorph">polymorph</a></em> (although <em><a href="#invisibility">invisibility</a></em>does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
<p><strong>Life Link (Su)</strong>: Starting at 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Summon Monster I</em> (Sp)</strong>: Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast <em><a href="#summon-monster-i">summon monster I</a></em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of <em><a href="#summon-monster-ix">summon monster IX</a></em> at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as <em><a href="#gate">gate</a></em> or <em><a href="#summon-monster-ix">summon monster IX</a></em>. If used as <em><a href="#gate">gate</a></em>, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one <em>summon monster</em> or <em><a href="#gate">gate</a></em>spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing <em>summon monster</em> or <em><a href="#gate">gate</a></em> immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of his spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, he can expend uses of this ability to fufill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
<p><strong>Bond Senses (Su)</strong>: Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Ally (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Maker's Call (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as <em><a href="#dimension-door">dimension door</a></em>, using the summoner's caster level. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Transposition (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker's call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
<p><strong>Aspect (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well. He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions he receives from these points any time he can change the eidolon's evolutions.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Shield Ally (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, whenever an ally is within an eidolon's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Life Bond (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, a summoner's life becomes linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative his points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like <em><a href="#baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a></em>,<em><a href="#flesh-to-stone">flesh to stone</a></em>, or <em><a href="#imprisonment">imprisonment</a></em>, or other spells that do not cause actual damage.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Forms (Su)</strong>: At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Aspect (Su)</strong>: At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner.</p>
<p><strong>Twin Eidolon (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
<h3 id="eidolons">Eidolons</h3>
<p>An eidolon's abilities are determined by the summoner's level and by the choices made using its evolution pool. Table 2–9: Eidolon Base Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the eidolon. Each eidolon possesses a base form that modifies these base statistics. Eidolons are outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.</p>
<p><strong>Class Level</strong>: This is the character's summoner level.</p>
<p><strong>HD</strong>: This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the eidolon possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.</p>
<p><strong>BAB</strong>: This is the eidolon's base attack bonus. An eidolon's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Good/Bad Saves</strong>: These are the eidolon's base saving throw bonuses. An eidolon possesses two good saving throws and one bad saving throw, determined by the creature's base form.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: This lists the eidolon's total skill ranks. An eidolon can assign skill ranks to any skill, but it must possess the appropriate appendages to use some skills. Eidolons with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (an eidolon receives a number of skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per HD). An eidolon cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Eidolon skill ranks are set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the summoner gains a new level.</p>
<p><strong>Feats</strong>: This is the total number of feats possessed by an eidolon. Eidolons can select any feat that they qualify for, but they must possess the appropriate appendages to use some feats. Eidolon feats are set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the summoner gains a new level. If, due to changes, the eidolon no longer qualifies for a feat, the feat has no effect until the eidolon once again qualifies for the feat.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Bonus</strong>: The number noted here is the eidolon's base total armor bonus. This bonus may be split between an armor bonus and a natural armor bonus, as decided by the summoner. This number is modified by the eidolon's base form and some options available through its evolution pool. An eidolon cannot wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the summoner's connection to the eidolon.</p>
<p><strong>Str/Dex Bonus</strong>: Add this modifier to the eidolon's Strength and Dexterity scores, as determined by its base form. Some options available through the eidolon's evolution pool might modify these scores.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution Pool</strong>: The value given in this column is the total number of points in the eidolon's evolution pool. Points from this pool can be spent on a wide variety of modifications and upgrades that add new abilities, attacks, and powers to the eidolon. Whenever the summoner gains a level, the number in this pool increases and the summoner can spend these points to change the abilities of the eidolon. These choices are not set. The summoner can change them whenever he gains a level (and through the <em><a href="#transmogrify">transmogrify</a></em>spell).</p>
<p><strong>Max. Attacks</strong>: This indicates the maximum number of natural attacks that the eidolon is allowed to possess at the given level. If the eidolon is at its maximum, it cannot take evolutions that grant additional natural attacks. This does not include attacks made with weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: This includes a number of abilities gained by all eidolons as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.</p>
<p><em><a href="#darkvision">Darkvision</a> (Ex)</em>: The eidolon has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p><em>Link (Ex)</em>: A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the summoner to give orders to his eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the summoner's connection to his eidolon. As a result, the summoner and his eidolon share magic item slots. For example, if the summoner is wearing a ring, his eidolon can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the summoner remain active, and those used by the eidolon become dormant. The eidolon must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.</p>
<p><em>Share Spells (Ex)</em>: The summoner may cast a spell with a target of “you” on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A summoner may cast spells on his eidolon even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the eidolon's type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell list. This ability does not allow the eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.</p>
<p><em>Evasion (Ex)</em>: If an eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p><em>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</em>: The eidolon adds +1 to one of its ability scores.</p>
<p><em>Devotion (Ex)</em>: An eidolon gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p><em><a href="#multiattack">Multiattack</a></em>: An eidolon gains <a href="#multiattack">Multiattack</a> as a bonus feat if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more natural attacks (or it is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the eidolon instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty. If the eidolon later gains 3 or more natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead gains <a href="#multiattack">Multiattack</a>.</p>
<p><em>Improved Evasion (Ex)</em>: When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>

<p>Each eidolon has one of three base forms that determines its starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All natural attacks are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted (such as in the case of secondary attacks). Eidolon attacks add the eidolon's Strength modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. These base forms also note any free evolutions that base form possesses. The bonuses from these free evolutions are already factored into the starting statistics.</p>
<p>Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a Small eidolon. If the eidolon is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to its Dexterity score. It also takes a –4 penalty to its Strength and a –2 penalty to its Constitution. It also gains a +1 size bonus to its AC and attack rolls, a –1 penalty to its CMB and CMD scores, a +2 bonus on its <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill checks, and a +4 bonus on its <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> skill checks. Reduce the damage of all of its attacks by one step (1d6 becomes 1d4, 1d4 becomes 1d3). If this choice is made, the eidolon can be made Medium whenever the summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool (which causes it to lose these modifiers for being Small).</p>
<h4 id="quadruped">Quadruped</h4>
<p><strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong>Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 14, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; <strong>Free Evolutions</strong> bite, limbs (legs) (2).</p>
<h4 id="biped">Biped</h4>

<h4 id="serpentine">Serpentine</h4>
<p><strong>Starting Statistics</strong>: <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft., climb 20 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong>Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6), tail slap (1d6); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; <strong>Free Evolutions</strong>bite, climb, reach (bite), tail, tail slap.</p>
<h3 id="evolutions">Evolutions</h3>
<p>Each eidolon receives a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus – 5 and add 1/2 the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the eidolon only has a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type.</p>
<p>Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever the summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can only be selected once.</p>
<h4 id="point-evolutions">1-Point Evolutions</h4>
<p>The following evolutions cost 1 point from the eidolon's evolution pool.</p>
<p><em>Bite (Ex)</em>: An eidolon's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite attack. This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge).

<p>The following evolutions cost 3 points from the eidolon's evolution pool.</p>
<p><em>Blindsense (Ex)</em>: An eidolon's senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it cannot see without having to make a <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon. Visibility still affects the eidolon's movement and it is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<p><em>Burrow (Ex)</em>: An eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed.

<p><em>Frightful Presence (Ex)</em>: An eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must make a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes with more HD than the eidolon are immune to this effect. The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<p><em>Swallow Whole (Ex)</em>: An eidolon gains the swallow whole ability, giving it the ability to consume its foes. If the eidolon begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it can attempt a combat maneuver check to swallow the creature. The creature can be up to one size category smaller than the eidolon. Swallowed creatures take damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each round plus 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light slashing or piercing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the eidolon's mouth, where it can attempt to escape or be swallowed again. The eidolon must possess the grab evolution, tied to a bite attack, to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<p><em><a href="#web">Web</a> (Ex)</em>: An eidolon gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs.

It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to 8 times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with an <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check or a Strength check (at a –4 penalty). The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Con modifier. The webs have a Hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint any creature touching its webs. The eidolon must possess the climb evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<h4 id="point-evolutions-3">4-Point Evolutions</h4>
<p>The following evolutions cost 4 points from the eidolon's evolution pool.</p>
<p><em>Blindsight (Ex)</em>: An eidolon's senses sharpen even further, granting it blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The eidolon can maneuver and attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility, and most forms of concealment as long as it has line of effect to the target.

<p><em>Breath Weapon (Su)</em>: An eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per HD it possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The eidolon can use this ability 1 additional time per day by spending an additional 1 evolution point (maximum 3/day). The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<p><em>Fast Healing (Su)</em>: An eidolon's body gains the ability to heal wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals 1 point of damage each round, just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (maximum 5). The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<p><em>Large (Ex)</em>: An eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The eidolon gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a –2 penalty to its Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a –1 size penalty to its AC and on attack rolls, a +1 bonus to its CMB and CMD, a –2 penalty on <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill checks, and a –4 penalty on <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> skill checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains 10-foot reach. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. The eidolon must be Medium to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 8th level before selecting this evolution.</p>
<p>If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead becomes Huge. The eidolon gains a +16 bonus to Strength, a +8 bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a –4 penalty to its Dexterity. This size change also give the creature a –2 size penalty to its AC and attack rolls, a +2 bonus to its CMB and CMD, 10-foot reach, a –4 penalty on <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill checks, and a –8 penalty on <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> skill checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet (10 feet for all other base forms). Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from becoming Large. The summoner must be at least 13th level before selecting this option.</p>
<p>The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution points) when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a Large or Huge eidolon.</p>
<p><em>Spell <a href="#resistance">Resistance</a> (Ex)</em>: An eidolon is protected against magic, gaining spell resistance. The eidolon's spell resistance is equal to 11 + the summoner's level. This spell resistance does not apply to spells cast by the summoner. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.</p>

<h2 id="witch">Witch</h2>
<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches' spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6.</p>

<h3 id="class-features-4">Class Features</h3>
<p>The following are the class features of the witch.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch's gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch's spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2–10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>).</p>
<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
<p><strong>Cantrips</strong>: Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2–10 under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
<p><strong>Hex</strong>: Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2–10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch's level + the witch's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Blight (Su)</em>: The witch can curse an animal, plant creature, or plot of land, causing it to wither and die. Blighting an area takes 1 round, during which time the witch and her familiar must be in contact with the target. If it's used on a plot of land, the land begins to wither the following day, and over the next week all plants in the area die. Nothing will grow in that area so long as the curse persists. A witch can affect an area with a radius equal to her class level × 10 feet. Blighting a creature is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If used on a creature of the animal or plant type, the creature gains the following curse: Blight Hex-<em>type</em> curse; <em>save</em>Will negates; <em>frequency</em> 1/day; <em>effect</em> 1 Con damage. Both types of curse can be removed with a <em><a href="#remove-curse">remove curse</a></em> or similar magic, using the save DC as the DC to remove the curse. A witch can only have one blight in effect at a time. If another blight hex is made, the first immediately ends.</p>
<p><em>Cackle (Su)</em>: A witch can cackle madly as a move action. Any creature that is within 30 feet that is under the effects of an agony hex, charm hex, evil eye hex, fortune hex, or misfortune hex caused by the witch has the duration of that hex extended by 1 round.</p>
<p><em>Cauldron (Ex)</em>: The witch receives <a href="#brew-potion">Brew Potion</a> as a bonus feat and a +4 insight bonus on <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) skill checks.</p>
<p><em>Charm (Su)</em>: A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the witch had successfully used the <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the target creature by 2 steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>
<p><em>Coven (Ex)</em>: The witch counts as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one hag. In addition, whenever the witch with this hex is within 30 feet of another witch with this hex, she can use the aid another action to grant a +1 bonus to the other witch's caster level for 1 round. This bonus applies to the witch's spells and all of her hexes.</p>
<p><em>Disguise (Su)</em>: A witch can change her appearance for a number of hours equal to her class level, as if using <em><a href="#disguise-self">disguise self</a></em>. These hours do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>
<p><em>Evil Eye (Su)</em>: The witch can cause doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target takes a –2 penalty on one of the following (witch's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save reduces this to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. At 8th level the penalty increases to –4.</p>
<p><em>Flight (Su)</em>: The witch grows lighter as she gains power, eventually gaining the ability to fly. At 1st level, the witch can use <em><a href="#feather-fall">feather fall</a></em> at will and gains a +4 racial bonus on <a href="#swim">Swim</a> checks. At 3rd level, she can cast <em><a href="#levitate">levitate</a></em> once per day. At 5th level, she can fly, as per the spell, for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. This hex only affects the witch.</p>
<p><em>Fortune (Su)</em>: The witch can grant a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1 round. The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing him to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better result. He must decide to use this ability before the first roll is made. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p>
<p><em>Healing (Su)</em>: A witch can soothe the wounds of those she touches. This acts as a <em><a href="#cure-light-wounds">cure light wounds</a></em> spell, using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level, this hex acts like <em><a href="#cure-moderate-wounds">cure moderate wounds</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Misfortune (Su)</em>: The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A Will save negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Slumber (Su):</em> A witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to fall into a deep, magical sleep, as per the spell <em><a href="#sleep">sleep</a></em>. The creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. This hex can affect a creature of any HD. The creature will not wake due to noise or light, but others can rouse it with a standard action. This hex ends immediately if the creature takes damage. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Tongues (Su)</em>: A witch with this hex can understand any spoken language for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as <em><a href="#comprehend-languages">comprehend languages</a>.</em>This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th level, a witch can use this ability to speak any language, as per <em><a href="#tongues">tongues</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Ward (Su)</em>: A witch can use this hex to place a protective ward over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This ward lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A witch can have only one ward active at a time. If the witch uses this ability again, the previous ward immediately ends. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by +1.</p>
<p><strong>Witch's Familiar (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard's arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch's Familiar section.</p>
<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch's familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch's choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
<p><strong>Major Hex</strong>: Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
<p><em>Agony (Su)</em>: With a quick incantation, a witch can place this hex on one creature within 60 feet, causing them to suffer intense pain. The target is nauseated for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. A Fortitude save negates this effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Hag's Eye (Su)</em>: A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that she can see through. This functions as per the spell <em><a href="#arcane-eye">arcane eye</a></em>. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet who also have the coven hex can see through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it still controls it. The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
<p><em>Major Healing (Su)</em>: By calling upon eerie powers, the witch's touch can mend even the most terrible wounds of those she touches. This acts as <em><a href="#cure-serious-wounds">cure serious wounds</a></em>, using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the major healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 15th level, this hex acts like <em><a href="#cure-critical-wounds">cure critical wounds</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Nightmares (Su)</em>: Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a hex on a creature within 60 feet that causes its sleep to be tormented by terrible nightmares. This functions as the spell <em><a href="#nightmare">nightmare</a></em> each time the affected creature attempts to rest. A Will save negates this effect. If the save is failed, the target must make a new save each night or be unable to rest.</p>
<p><em>Retribution (Su)</em>: A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across the target's flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature in melee. Immediately after the hexed creature deals damage in melee, it takes half that damage (round down). This damage bypasses any resistances, immunities, or damage reduction the creature possesses. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect.</p>
<p><em>Vision (Su)</em>: A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of the future to a creature touched. Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during which time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one another. At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the vision.</p>
<p><em>Waxen Image (Su)</em>: The witch can spend a full-round action to create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within 30 feet. Once the image is complete, the subject must make a Will save. If the subject fails, the witch gains a small measure of control over the creature. Whenever she exercises this control, the creature receives a new Will save to end the effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can use the waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject to do any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed in any direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this attack automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything held. Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture the image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its turn. As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>
<p><em>Weather Control (Su)</em>: A witch with this hex can use <em><a href="#control-weather">control weather</a></em> once per day, but creating the weather takes 1 full hour of chanting, dancing, and communing with her familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Grand Hex</strong>: Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
<p><em>Death Curse (Su)</em>: This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted. On the third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save. Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Eternal Slumber (Su)</em>: The witch can touch a creature, causing it to drift off into a permanent slumber. The creature receives a Will save to negate this effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep and cannot be woken. The effect can only be removed with a <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em> or similar magic, although slaying the witch ends the effect. The witch can use this ability to poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Forced Reincarnation (Su)</em>: The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately <em>reincarnated</em> into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell <em><a href="#reincarnate">reincarnate</a></em>. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Life Giver (Su)</em>: Once per day the witch can, as a full round action, touch a dead creature and bring it back to life. This functions as <em><a href="#resurrection">resurrection</a></em>, but it does not require a material component.</p>
<p><em>Natural Disaster (Su)</em>: A witch using this hex calls down the forces of nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a <em><a href="#storm-of-vengeance">storm of vengeance</a></em>combined with an <em><a href="#earthquake">earthquake</a></em> that occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this ability once per day.</p>
<h3 id="witchs-familiar">Witch's Familiar</h3>
<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch's spell list.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#spells">Spells</a> Gained at a New Level</strong>: A <a href="#witch&#39;s-familiar">witch's familiar</a> learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two <a href="#spells">spells</a> from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free <a href="#spells">spells</a> must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar Teaching Familiar</strong>: A <a href="#witch&#39;s-familiar">witch's familiar</a> can learn <a href="#spells">spells</a> from another <a href="#witch&#39;s-familiar">witch's familiar</a>. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a>. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of <a href="#spells">spells</a> for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its <a href="#spells">spells</a> to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Learn from a Scroll</strong>: A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>
<h4 id="adding-spells-to-a-witchs-familiar">Adding Spells to a Witch's Familiar</h4>
<p>By forging strange bonds with unnameable beings, witches gain the service of a mystical advisor, a familiar to both serve her and reveal to her secrets unknown to most mortals. A familiar is an animal chosen by a witch to aid her in her spellcasting and grant her special powers. This uses the same rules as the wizard's <a href="#arcane-bond">arcane bond</a> class feature, except as noted below. A witch uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her familiar. A witch can choose any of the familiars available to a wizard in addition to the new familiars presented here.</p>
<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the witch's level. If a witch possesses such levels, her familiar always uses the witch rules for familiars, not those provided by other classes, such as wizards or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline. A witch's familiar only stores witch spells. All other spells are stored normally, as noted in their class features.</p>
<p>If a familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 day later through a special ritual that costs 500 gp per witch level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. A new familiar begins knowing all of the 0-level spells plus two spells of every level the witch is able to cast. These are in addition to any bonus spells known by the familiar based on the witch's level and her patron (see patron spells).</p>
<p><em>Store Spells</em>: Starting at 1st level, a witch's familiar stores all of the spells that the witch knows. This does not allow the familiar to cast these spells or use spell-trigger or spell completion magic items. Starting at 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch's familiar adds new bonus spells to the witch's spell list based on her patron. These spells are automatically stored by the familiar and can be prepared as normal once they are gained.</p>
<p><em>Deliver Touch Spells (Su)</em>: If a witch is 3rd level or higher, her familiar can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the witch and the familiar are in contact at the time the witch casts a touch spell, she can designate her familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the witch would. As usual, if the witch casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the witch activates a hex, her familiar can be used to make the touch. She does not have to be in contact with the familiar to use this ability.</p>
<h4 id="new-familiars">New Familiars</h4>
<p>In addition to the familiars presented in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, witches might select any of the following animals as their familiar. Sorcerers and wizards might also adopt these new familiars, utilizing the same rules as for any other familiar.</p>
<p>These familiars make use these statistics: the <a href="">house centipede</a>, <a href="#crab-giant">king crab</a>, <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/magic/newFamiliars.html#greensting-scorpion-cr-1/4">greensting scorpion</a>, fox (<a href="#dog">dog</a> with the <a href="#young-creature">young template</a>), octopus (<a href="#octopus">octopus</a> with the <a href="#young-creature">young template</a>), and <a href="#spider-giant">scarlet spider</a>.</p>

<h3 id="patron-spells">Patron Spells</h3>
<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces. At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch's patron adds new spells to a witch's list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 5 of this book. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>

<h1 id="core-classes">Core Classes</h1>
<p>From the noble paladin to the skillful rogue, each core class in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</em> draws upon a central archetype. Yet, beyond that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable interpretations, details, and refinements. The fighter class, for example, might easily be sculpted into a dead-eye archer, a fleet-footed duelist, a stealthy jungle hunter, or countless other types of martial masters, all refined by a player's choice of details, class options, and specific rules. Yet some archetypes prove pervasive and exciting enough to see use in play time and time again. To help players interested in creating iconic fantasy characters, the following pages explore new rules, options, and alternate class features for each core class. So while most druids wander the woods, some track through the vast desert, reveling in what the wastes have to offer. Such optional features represent a unique view of what a class deliberately designed to capture a specific character archetype might become. While the types of options presented for each core class differ, each subsystem is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy archetypes, and expand players' freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.</p>
<h1 id="alternate-class-features">Alternate Class Features</h1>
<p>Most of the options presented on the following pages include a host of alternate class features. When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features found in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> or those listed in one of the archetypes presented here. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the elemental fist class feature of the monk of the four winds replaces the stunning fist class feature of the monk. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them—often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options. All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.</p>
<p>A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin could not be both a hospitaler and an undead scourge since they both modify the smite evil class feature and both replace the aura of justice class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an undead scourge and a warrior of the holy light, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.</p>
<h1 id="adapting-existing-characters">Adapting Existing Characters</h1>
<p>Players with existing characters should talk with their GM about whether on not these alternate class features are available in her game, and if so, whether they can recreate their characters to adopt them. As alternate class features are designed to be balanced when compared to those in the core class, players who revise their characters shouldn't be gaining any special advantage over other party members. As long as the GM is comfortable with retroactively adjusting character specifics, there should be no disruption to future adventures. Typically, the best time for a player to adopt alternate class features and significantly revise his character is when leveling up between adventures, though he should always check with the GM before doing so, as she may wish to work significant changes to a character into the campaign.</p>
<p>While the GM might want to make concessions for players who didn't have these alternate class features available to them when creating their characters, PCs should be one of the most constant elements of a campaign. Constantly changing and recreating characters can prove problematic to a campaign. While the GM should be willing to adapt and may allow players who grow bored with their characters to redefine them, alternate class abilities shouldn't feel like exploitable options allowing PCs to build and rebuild their characters in whatever ways seem most advantageous at a given moment. Allowing players to remake characters in light of newly adopted rules may be desirable on occasion, but GMs shouldn't feel like they're being unfair or breaking any rule by not allowing players to rebuild characters or by disallowing certain options. While the GM should always strive to help players run the characters they want, ultimately she knows what's best for the campaign.</p>

<h1 id="barbarian">Barbarian</h1>
<p>The true barbarian is a creature of bestial, savage fury. Whether a stoic tribal champion who whips herself into a berserker frenzy for the good of her sword-sisters, or a chaotic warrior who revels in carnage for its own sake, all barbarians share a similar approach to combat. Once the red haze of bloodlust descends, there is only a burning rage that carries them through the screaming fray, heedless of wounds and leaving scattered corpses in their wake.</p>
<p>Presented below are a number of new rage powers to help you customize your barbarian, as well as several classic barbarian archetypes to help you in building your character, each one including a number of suggested rage powers that, while not mandatory, work to flesh out the character concept. Rage powers marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers (Ex)</strong>: The following new rage powers can be taken by any barbarian that meets the prerequisites. Totem rage powers grant powers in a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian that selects a beast totem rage power cannot later chose to gain any of the spirit totem rage powers.</p>
<p><em>Beast Totem (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the barbarian has attained. A barbarian must have the lesser beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Beast Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains the pounce special ability, allowing her to make a full attack at the end of a charge. In addition, the damage from her claws increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) and the claws deal x3 damage on a critical hit. A barbarian must have the beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Beast Totem, Lesser (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier.</p>
<p><em>Boasting <a href="#taunt">Taunt</a> (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> check to demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.</p>
<p><em>Brawler</em>: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has <a href="#improved-unarmed-strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>. If she already has the feat, her unarmed strikes deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if she is Small).</p>
<p><em>Brawler, Greater</em>: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has <a href="#two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> when making unarmed strike attacks. A barbarian must have the brawler rage power to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Chaos Totem (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian's form becomes infused with chaos. She gains a +4 bonus on <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> checks and has a 25% chance to ignore extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. A barbarian must have the lesser chaos totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Chaos Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains DR/lawful equal to 1/2 her barbarian level. Her weapons and natural weapons are considered chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A barbarian must have the chaos totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Chaos Totem, Lesser (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC against the attacks of lawful creatures and a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against confusion, insanity, polymorph, and effects with the lawful descriptor. This bonus increases by +1 for each chaos totem rage power she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Come and Get Me (Ex)</em>: While raging, as a free action the barbarian may leave herself open to attack while preparing devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the barbarian until the beginning of her next turn, but every attack against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is resolved prior to resolving each enemy attack. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em><a href="#disruptive">Disruptive</a></em>: When raging, the barbarian gains <a href="#disruptive">Disruptive</a> as a bonus feat. The barbarian must have the superstition* rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Elemental <a href="#rage">Rage</a> (Su)</em>: While raging, all of the barbarian's melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The type is chosen when the barbarian begins her rage. A barbarian must have the lesser elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use her lesser elemental rage power while using this rage power, but she must select a different energy type.</p>
<p><em>Elemental <a href="#rage">Rage</a>, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, all of the barbarian's critical hits made with melee weapons deal an additional 1d10 points of energy damage (2d10 if the weapon deals x3 damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals x4 on a critical hit). The type of this damage is the same as the type chosen for the elemental rage power. A barbarian must have the elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Elemental <a href="#rage">Rage</a>, Lesser (Su)</em>: As a swift action, the barbarian can cause her melee attacks to deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) for 1 round. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power. This power can only be used once per rage.</p>
<p><em>Energy Absorption (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack of her chosen energy type once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it, instead gaining 1 temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of the barbarian's rage. A barbarian must have the greater energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Energy Eruption (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. The breath weapon inflicts damage equal to the damage from the attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did not allow a save. A barbarian must have the energy absorption rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 16th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Energy <a href="#resistance">Resistance</a> (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected and it cannot be changed. This rage power can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time is applies to a different energy type.</p>
<p><em>Energy <a href="#resistance">Resistance</a>, Greater (Ex)</em>: Once per rage, a barbarian can reduce damage by half from a single attack against which she has energy resistance (halve the damage, then apply resistance). A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Ferocious <a href="#mount">Mount</a> (Ex)</em>: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount also gains the benefits of rage (including greater rage and mighty rage) as long as the barbarian is mounted or adjacent to it. While her mount is raging in this way, she must spend one additional round of rage per round. She can elect not to pay this cost, in which case her mount does not rage.</p>
<p><em>Ferocious <a href="#mount">Mount</a>, Greater (Ex)</em>: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the benefits of any rage powers that are constant in effect when the barbarian is raging. It does not gain the benefit of any rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Ferocious <a href="#trample">Trample</a> (Ex)</em>: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the trample special attack (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em> 305). This attack inflicts 1d8 points of damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge mount, plus 1–1/2 times the mount's Strength modifier. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the mount's Strength modifier) halves this damage. Creatures in the mount's path or that threaten squares it passes through may make attacks of opportunity against either the barbarian or the mount, but not both. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Ferocious <a href="#trample">Trample</a>, Greater (Ex)</em>: A barbarian's mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its ferocious trample.

A barbarian must have the ferocious trample rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>

A barbarian must have the lesser fiend totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Fiend Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian is surrounded by an aura of menace. Good creatures adjacent to the barbarian are shaken and take 2d6 points of slashing damage at the beginning of the barbarian's turn as dozens of small cuts open across their flesh. Neutral creatures that are adjacent to the barbarian are shaken, but do not take any damage. Evil creatures are unaffected. A barbarian must have the fiend totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Fiend Totem, Lesser (Su)</em>: While raging, the barbarian grows a pair of large horns, gaining a gore attack. This attack is a primary attack (unless she is also attacking with weapons, in which case it is a secondary attack) and is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus (–5 if it is a secondary attack). The gore attack deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (1d6 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier (1/2 if it is a secondary attack).</p>
<p><em>Flesh Wound (Ex)</em>: Once per rage, the barbarian can try to avoid serious harm from an attack.

<p><em>Good for What Ails You (Ex)</em>: While raging, the barbarian who takes a drink of alcohol may attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions that may be affecting her: blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or sickened. If she succeeds at the save, the effect is suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also may attempt a new saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts against those required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill effect.</p>
<p><em>Ground Breaker (Ex)</em>: Once per rage, the barbarian can attack the floor around her as a standard action. This attack automatically hits and deals damage normally. If the barbarian manages to deal more damage than the floor's hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in these squares, except the barbarian, must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be knocked prone. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Guarded Life (Ex)</em>: While raging, if the barbarian is reduced below 0 hit points, 1 hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If the barbarian is at negative hit points due to lethal damage, she immediately stabilizes.</p>

This inflicts damage as a falling object (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 443) plus the barbarian's Strength bonus. This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a ranged touch attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) for half damage. The barbarian may apply <a href="#power-attack">Power Attack</a> to this attack as a one- or two-handed weapon, as appropriate.</p>

A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
<p><em>Spirit Totem (Su)</em>: While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian make it difficult for her enemies to see her.

<p><em>Spirit Totem, Greater (Su)</em>: While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian become dangerous to any enemy adjacent to the barbarian.

<h1 id="breaker">Breaker</h1>
<p>While most barbarians are skilled at breaking things, some find the need to destroy their surroundings an almost uncontrollable urge when in the middle of a rage. These barbarians are a danger not only to their foes, but also to the very environment around them. A breaker barbarian has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Destructive (Ex)</strong>: Whenever the breaker barbarian makes a melee attack that targets an unattended object or makes a sunder combat maneuver, she adds half her barbarian level (minimum +1) on the damage roll. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Scavenger (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the breaker barbarian suffers no penalty on attack rolls when using an improvised weapon or a weapon with the broken condition. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls with improvised or broken weapons for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the breaker archetype: ground breaker, smasher, and strength surge*.</p>
<h1 id="brutal-pugilist">Brutal Pugilist</h1>

<p><strong>Savage Grapple (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, the brutal pugilist takes only half the normal penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition.

<p><strong>Pit Fighter (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the brutal pugilist has learned combat tricks from fighting in pit brawls and gladiatorial arenas. She selects one combat maneuver and gains a +1 insight bonus on her CMB or to her CMD in that maneuver. This bonus increases to +2 if the barbarian is wearing no armor (shields are allowed). At every three levels after 3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this bonus on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no more than twice, once on CMB and once to CMD. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Savage Grapple (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, the brutal pugilist takes no penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition.

<p><strong>Raging Drunk (Ex)</strong>: While raging, the drunken brute can drink a potion, or a tankard of ale or similar quantity of alcohol, as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink allows the barbarian to maintain her rage that round without expending a round of rage for the day (instead of the alcohol's normal effects). For each alcoholic drink consumed while raging, the barbarian is nauseated for 1 round when her rage expires, in addition to the normal fatigue that follows a rage. Tireless rage does not negate this nauseated condition but the internal fortitude rage power does. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Powers</strong>: The following rage powers complement the drunken brute archetype: boasting taunt, good for what ails you, internal fortitude*, liquid courage, moment of clarity*, roaring drunk, and staggering drunk.</p>
<h1 id="elemental-kin">Elemental Kin</h1>
<p>Some barbarian tribes have strong ties to the elemental forces of nature. Their shamans anoint the warriors at birth, tying them to the patron element of the tribe and granting them lasting boons against such forces. An elemental kin has the following class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Fury (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, whenever the elemental kin takes an amount of energy damage equal to or greater than her barbarian level while raging, she adds 1 to the total number of rounds that she can rage that day. At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the number of extra rounds per energy attack increases by +1, to a maximum of +6 rounds per energy attack at at 18th level.

<p><strong>Invulnerability (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, the invulnerable rager gains DR/— equal to half her barbarian level. This damage reduction is doubled against nonlethal damage. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and damage reduction.</p>

<h1 id="mounted-fury">Mounted Fury</h1>
<p>Many barbarian tribes are masters of the horse, teaching their members how to ride from a young age. As a result, barbarians from such tribes are even more terrifying when mounted, using their steeds' speed and strength to great advantage. A mounted fury has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Rider (Ex)</strong>: The speed of any mount the barbarian rides is increased by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
<p><strong>Bestial Mount (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as a druid's animal companion, using the barbarian's level –4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level.

<h1 id="superstitious">Superstitious</h1>
<p>Many barbarians distrust magic. While most just shy away from magic, others focus their rage on users of such foul arts. These barbarians are naturally distrusting, and develop keen senses to protect them from harm. A superstitious barbarian has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth Sense (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the superstitious barbarian gains a +1 bonus on initiative and a +1 insight bonus to AC during surprise rounds. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>

In addition to the totem powers themselves, the following rage powers complement the totem warrior archtype (depending on the totem chosen): animal fury*, low-light vision*, night vision*, raging climber*, raging leaper*, raging swimmer*, and swift foot*.</p>
<p>Bard</p>
<h1 id="bard">Bard</h1>
<p>A good bard can sing the birds from the trees or talk a king into abdicating his throne. A jack of all trades, the bard sees little need to restrict himself to a single talent, picking up a little of this and a little of that, but always with a keen eye for other people and how they might be manipulated, whether through artistic performances or more mundane avenues. Presented below are several classic bardic themes.</p>
<h1 id="arcane-duelist">Arcane Duelist</h1>
<p>A master of the martial applications of steel and spell, the arcane duelist blends both into a lethal combination.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#arcane-strike">Arcane Strike</a></strong>: Arcane duelists gain <a href="#arcane-strike">Arcane Strike</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: An arcane duelist gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Rallying Cry (Su)</em>: At 1st level, an arcane duelist can use performance to rally dispirited allies. Each round he makes an <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> check. Any ally (including the bard) within 30 feet may use this check in place of his own saving throw against fear and despair effects. Those already under a fear or despair effect can attempt a new save each round using the bard's <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> check. Rallying cry does not work on effects that don't allow saves. This is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces countersong.</p>
<p><em>Bladethirst (Su)</em>: An arcane duelist of 6th level or higher may use performance to grant one weapon, one natural weapon, one end of a double weapon, or 50 items of ammunition of the same type within 30 feet a +1 enhancement bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 6th (maximum +5 at 18th level). These bonuses stack with existing bonuses and may be used to increase the item's enhancement bonus up to +5 or to add any of the following weapon properties: <em><a href="#weapons-defending">defending</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-distance">distance</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-ghost-touch">ghost touch</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-keen">keen</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-mighty-cleaving">mighty cleaving</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-returning">returning</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-shock">shock</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-shocking-burst">shocking burst</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-seeking">seeking</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-speed">speed</a></em>, or <em><a href="#wounding">wounding</a></em>. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before adding special abilities. This performance replaces suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Mass Bladethirst (Su)</em>: An arcane duelist of 18th level or higher can use his bladethirst performance to enhance the weapons of as many allies as desired within 30 feet. The bonus provided by this power is +4 if conferred on two allies, +3 for three allies, +2 for four allies, and +1 for five or more allies. The power granted to each weapon must be identical. This ability replaces mass suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: An arcane duelist weaves might and magic in his combat style, gaining the following bonus feats at 2nd level and every four levels thereafter: 2nd level—<a href="#combat-casting">Combat Casting</a>, 6th level—<a href="#disruptive">Disruptive</a>, 10th level—<a href="#spellbreaker">Spellbreaker</a>, 14th level—<a href="#penetrating-strike">Penetrating Strike</a>, 18th level—<a href="#greater-penetrating-strike">Greater Penetrating Strike</a>. This ability replaces versatile performance and well-versed.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an arcane duelist gains the arcane bond ability as a wizard, using a weapon as his bonded item, allowing him to cast any one addition spell that he knows once per day. He may not choose a familiar or other type of bonded item. He may use the hand holding his bonded weapon for somatic components. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Armor (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, an arcane duelist gains Medium Armor Proficiency and can cast bard spells in medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure. At 16th level, he gains Heavy Armor Proficiency and can cast bard spells in heavy armor with no arcane spell failure. This ability replaces jack of all trades.</p>
<h1 id="archivist">Archivist</h1>
<p>Some bards greatly prefer academic pursuits to the drama (and sometimes melodrama) of their artistic brethren.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: An archivist gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Naturalist (Ex)</em>: An archivist who has identified a creature with a <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> check appropriate to its type can use performance to share strategies for defeating it with allies in combat. The archivist and any allies within 30 feet gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on attack rolls and saving throws against exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by creatures of that specific kind of monster (e.g., frost giants, not all giants or all humanoids). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. This language-dependent ability requires visual and audible components. This ability replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>Lamentable Belaborment (Ex)</em>: At 6th level, an archivist can bewilder a creature already fascinated by his performance. Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours, but failure leaves the target either dazed or confused (archivist's choice) for as long as the performance continues. If the target takes damage, this effect ends immediately. This mind-affecting ability relies on audible components. This ability replaces suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Pedantic Lecture (Su)</em>: At 18th level, an archivist can affect as many creatures with lamentable belaborment as he currently has fascinated. In addition, he may choose to cause targets to fall asleep rather than be dazed or confused. This ability replaces mass suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Lore Master (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an archivist may take 20 on <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> checks once per day, plus once per six levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Lore (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an archivist gains a bonus on <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> checks to identify magic items or decipher scrolls equal to half his bard level and may take 10 on such checks. An archivist can use <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> to disarm magical traps as per a rogue's trapfinding ability and gains a +4 bonus on saves against magical traps, language-dependent effects, and symbols, glyphs, and magical writings of any kind. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
<p><strong>Jack of All Trades (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an archivist can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires him to be trained. At 11th level, he considers all skills to be class skills, and at 17th level he can take 10 on any skill check, even if it is not normally allowed. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
<p><strong>Probable Path (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, an archivist can calculate the action likely to bring success with the least risk. Once per day, he can take 10 on any d20 roll. He may use this ability one additional time per day for every three levels after 10th. This ability replaces jack of all trades.</p>
<h1 id="court-bard">Court Bard</h1>
<p>Spending years studying all of the finer points of erudition and etiquette, the court bard takes up the role of resplendent proclaimer and artist-in-residence at the hand of nobility, royalty, and the well-moneyed elite who aspire to join their ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A court bard gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Satire (Su)</em>: A court bard can use performance to undermine the confidence of enemies who hear it, causing them to take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a –1 penalty on saves against fear and charm effects as long as the bard continues performing. This penalty increases by –1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Satire is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>Mockery (Su)</em>: A court bard of 3rd level or higher can subtly ridicule and defame a specific individual. The bard selects one target who can hear his performance. That individual takes a –2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks as long as the bard continues performing. This penalty increases by –1 every four levels after 3rd. Mockery is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that relies on audible components. This performance replaces inspire competence.</p>
<p><em>Glorious Epic (Su)</em>: A court bard of 8th level or higher can weave captivating tales that engross those who hear them. Enemies within 30 feet become flat-footed unless they succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). A save renders them immune to this ability for 24 hours. Glorious epic is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.</p>
<p><em>Scandal (Su)</em>: A court bard of 14th level or higher can combine salacious gossip and biting calumny to incite a riot. Each enemy within 30 feet is affected as if by a <em><a href="#song-of-discord">song of discord</a></em> for as long as it can hear the performance. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect, and that creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Scandal is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces frightening tune.</p>
<p><strong>Heraldic Expertise (Ex)</strong>: A court bard gains a bonus equal to half his bard level on <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (history), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local), and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nobility) checks (minimum +1). Once per day, the court bard can also reroll a check against one of these skills, though he must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. He can reroll one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Audience (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a court bard can choose to affect a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot radius with bardic performances that affect an area. In addition, for every five levels beyond 5th, the area of such powers is increased by 10 feet (radius) or 20 feet (cone). If the power instead affects multiple creatures, it affects one additional creature than normal for every five levels beyond 5th. This does not affect powers that affect only a single creature. This ability replaces lore master and jack of all trades.</p>
<h1 id="detective">Detective</h1>
<p>Piecing together clues and catching the guilty with sheer cleverness, the detective is skilled at divining the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A detective gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Careful Teamwork (Su)</em>: A detective uses performance to keep allies coordinated, alert, and ready for action. All allies within 30 feet gain a +1 bonus on Initiative checks, <a href="#perception">Perception</a>, and <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks for 1 hour. They also gain a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saves and to AC against traps and when they are flat-footed. These bonuses increase by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Using this ability requires 3 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires visual and audible components. This performance replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>True Confession (Su)</em>: At 9th level, a detective can use performance to trick a creature into revealing its secrets. Using this ability requires a successful <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check to see through a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> or notice mental compulsion. After 3 continuous rounds of performance, the target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. On a failed save, a liar inadvertently reveals the lie and the truth behind it. A creature under a charm or compulsion reveals the nature of its enchantment and who placed it (if the creature knows) and gains a new saving throw to break free from the enchantment. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. Using this power requires only 2 rounds of performance at 15th level, and 1 round of performance at 20th level. This performance replaces inspire greatness.</p>
<p><em>Show Yourselves (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, a detective can use performance to compel creatures to reveal themselves when hiding. All enemies within 30 feet must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). If they fail, they must cease using <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a>, unlock and open doors between themselves and the detective, and dismiss, suppress, or dispel if necessary magical effects that grant invisibility or any other form of concealment from the detective. As long as they can hear the performance, affected creatures may not attack or flee until they have eliminated every such effect, though they are freed from this compulsion immediately if attacked. Creatures in the area must make this save each round the bard continues his performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. This performance replaces inspire heroics.</p>
<p><strong>Eye for Detail (Ex)</strong>: A detective gains a bonus equal to half his level on <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local), <a href="#perception">Perception</a>, and <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks, as well as <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks to gather information (minimum +1). This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Insight (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a detective can find and disable magical traps, like a rogue's trapfinding ability. In addition, he gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against illusions and a +4 bonus on caster level checks and saving throws to see through disguises and protections against divination (such as <em><a href="#magic-aura">magic aura</a></em>, <em><a href="#misdirection">misdirection</a></em>, and <em><a href="#nondetection">nondetection</a></em>). This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Investigation</strong>: In addition, a detective's class spell list includes the following: 1st—<em><a href="#detect-chaos">detect chaos</a>/evil/law/good</em>; 2nd—<em><a href="#zone-of-truth">zone of truth</a></em>; 3rd—<em><a href="#arcane-eye">arcane eye</a>, <a href="#speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a>, <a href="#speak-with-plants">speak with plants</a></em>; 4th—<em><a href="#discern-lies">discern lies</a></em>; 5th—<em><a href="#prying-eyes">prying eyes</a>, <a href="#stone-tell">stone tell</a></em>; 6th—<em><a href="#discern-location">discern location</a>, <a href="#find-the-path">find the path</a>, <a href="#prying-eyes-greater">greater prying eyes</a>, <a href="#moment-of-prescience">moment of prescience</a></em>. A detective may add one of these spells or any divination spell on the bard spell list to his list of spells known at 2nd level and every four levels thereafter. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p>
<h1 id="magician">Magician</h1>
<p>A magician dabbles in performance, but sees it as a means to tap into universal energies and channel them.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A magician gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Dweomercraft (Su)</em>: A magician can use performance to manipulate magical energies. Allies of the magician gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks, concentration checks, and attack rolls with spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. This ability relies on visual and audible components. It replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>Spell Suppression (Su)</em>: A 8th level, a magician can use performance to counter the spells of his foes. Once the bard begins using this performance, he tracks the number of rounds it has been in use. While performing, as an immediate action, he can attempt to counter any spell that he can identify using <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a>, so long as that spell's level is equal or less than the total number of rounds he has been performing spell suppression. The attempt to counter the spell is made as if using <em><a href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>, using the bard's level as the caster level. If successful, the bardic performance immediately ends. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.</p>
<p><em>Metamagic Mastery (Ex)</em>: At 14th level, a magician can use performance to apply a metamagic feat to a spell he is about to cast without increasing the casting time. The bard must still expend a higher-level slot to cast this spell. This causes the performance to immediately end. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces frightening tune.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Talent (Ex)</strong>: A magician gains a bonus equal to half his level on <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana), <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a>, and <a href="#use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a> checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#improved-counterspell">Improved Counterspell</a></strong>: A magician gains <a href="#improved-counterspell">Improved Counterspell</a> as a bonus feat. This ability replaces countersong.</p>
<p><strong>Extended Performance (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a magician can extend the duration of bardic performance after he stops concentrating by sacrificing a spell slot as a swift action. The performance effect lingers for 1 extra round per level of the spell. Only one spell may be sacrificed per performance, and performance types that take affect after a specific number of rounds cannot be extended. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Repertoire (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, a magician can add one spell to his spells known from the spell list of any arcane spellcasting class. The spell must be of a level he can cast. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a magician gains the arcane bond ability as a wizard. He may not choose a familiar or a weapon as a bonded item. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
<p><strong>Wand Mastery (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, when a magician uses a wand containing a spell on his spell list, he uses his Charisma bonus to set the wand's save DC. At 16th level, when using such a wand, he uses his caster level in place of the wand's caster level. This ability replaces jack of all trades.</p>
<h1 id="sandman">Sandman</h1>
<p>Combining performance with stealth, trickery, and guile, the sandman uses cleverness to keep others off-balance.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A sandman gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Stealspell (Su)</em>: A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add them to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch attack as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts to its original owner. This ability requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>Slumber Song (Sp)</em>: At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep (as <em><a href="#deep-slumber">deep slumber</a></em>, but with no HD limit). Otherwise, this ability functions like suggestion. This performance replaces suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Dramatic Subtext (Su)</em>: At 9th level, a sandman can use bardic performance to cast spells without obvious visual or audible components while retaining the spell's normal effects. Observers must succeed at a <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check opposed by a sandman's <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check to notice that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected and the performance ends. This ability replaces inspire greatness.</p>
<p><em>Greater Stealspell (Su)</em>: A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a target fails a save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can then choose which spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce the target's SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately reverts back to its owner. This performance replaces inspire heroics.</p>
<p><em>Mass Slumber Song (Sp)</em>: At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions like <em><a href="#suggestion-mass">mass suggestion</a></em>. This performance replaces <em><a href="#suggestion-mass">mass suggestion</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Spell Catching (Su)</em>: At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's original caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell's level, even if the check fails. This performance replaces deadly performance.</p>
<p><strong>Master of Deception (Ex)</strong>: A sandman gains a bonus equal to half his level on <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a>, and <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> checks. He may also disarm magical traps with <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> as a rogue's trapfinding ability. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Sneakspell (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a sandman adds +1 to the save DC of spells and bardic performance against opponents who are denied their Dex bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 18th level. In addition, at 6th level he gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance against such foes, and this bonus increases to +4 at 14th level. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Sense (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a sandman gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves against traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three levels after 3rd. This ability replaces inspire competence.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a sandman inflicts +1d6 points of damage against targets within 30 feet that he flanks or that are denied their Dex bonus to AC against him. This damage increases by +1d6 every five levels after 5th. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
<h1 id="savage-skald">Savage Skald</h1>
<p>Far from civilization, furious tribes have their own war-singers, work-chanters, and lore-keepers, savaging enemies with song and sword alike.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A savage skald gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Inspiring Blow (Su)</em>: A savage skald roars his war-cries with each telling blow. When he confirms a critical hit, he can start this performance as an immediate action (ending any other performances). He gains temporary hit points equal to his Charisma modifier (if positive), and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on their next attack roll prior to the start of his next turn. These temporary hit points remain until the bard ends his performance. This performance replaces fascinate.</p>
<p><em>Incite <a href="#rage">Rage</a> (Su)</em>: At 6th level, a savage skald can induce a furious rage in one creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as a <em><a href="#rage">rage</a></em> spell that lasts as long as the target can hear the bard's performance; however, unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The bard cannot target himself with this ability. If the target has the rage class feature, it can instead immediately rage and stay in this rage without consuming rounds of rage per day as long as the bard continues performing. This mind-affecting effect requires audible components. This performance replaces suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Song of the Fallen (Sp)</em>: At 10th level, a savage skald can duplicate the effect of a <em>horn of Valhalla</em>. This effect requires 10 continuous rounds of performance and summons barbarians as a silver horn at 10th level, as a brass horn at 13th level, as a bronze horn at 16th level, and as an iron horn at 19th level. The warriors remain only as long as the bard continues his performance. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces jack of all trades.</p>
<p><em>Berserkergang (Ex)</em>: At 12th level, a savage skald can inspire a rapturous battle trance that suppresses pain, stunning, and fear effects for one creature, plus one additional creature per three levels after 12th. Affected creatures also gain DR 5/— (DR 10/— against nonlethal damage); this benefit stacks with the damage reduction class ability of barbarians. This mind-affecting ability requires audible components. This performance replaces soothing performance.</p>
<p><em>Battle Song (Su)</em>: At 18th level, a savage skald can affect all allies within 30 feet when using performance to incite rage. This performance replaces mass suggestion.</p>
<h1 id="sea-singer">Sea Singer</h1>
<p>The sea singer calls the blue waters his home, and is much in demand among sea captains wishing good fortune for their crew and hull as they ply the tradewinds far and wide.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A sea singer gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Sea Shanty (Su)</em>: A sea singer learns to counter seasickness and exhaustion during long sea voyages. Each round of a sea shanty, he makes a <a href="#perform">Perform</a> skill check. Allies within 30 feet (including the sea singer) may use his <a href="#perform">Perform</a> check in place of a saving throw against becoming exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, or sickened; if already under such an effect, a new save is allowed each round of the sea shanty, using the bard's <a href="#perform">Perform</a> check for the save. A sea shanty has no effect on instantaneous effects or effects that do not allow saves. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces countersong.</p>
<p><em>Still Water (Su)</em>: At 3rd level, a sea singer can use performance to calm rough waters within 30 feet, reducing the DC for <a href="#profession">Profession</a> (sailor) and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> checks, as well as for <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="#climb">Climb</a> checks aboard ship, by an amount equal to the bard's level (to a minimum of DC 10) for as long he continues to perform. He can extend this duration to 1 hour by playing for 10 consecutive rounds. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces inspire competence.</p>
<p><em>Whistle the Wind (Su)</em>: A sea singer of 6th level or higher can use performance to create a <em><a href="#gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a></em>. This wind lasts for as long as he continues his performance. He can extend this duration to 1 minute by playing for 5 consecutive rounds. This performance replaces suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Call the Storm (Su)</em>: At 18th level, a sea singer can use performance to duplicate <em><a href="#control-water">control water</a>, <a href="#control-weather">control weather</a>, <a href="#control-winds">control winds</a>,</em> or <em><a href="#storm-of-vengeance">storm of vengeance</a></em>, using his bard level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 1 round of continuous performance per level of the spell (as if he were a druid). These effects continue for as long as the bard continues performing (the effects on <em>control weather</em> happen immediately), but not longer than the spell's normal duration. This performance replaces mass suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>World Traveler (Ex)</strong>: A sea singer gains a bonus equal to half his bard level on <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature), and <a href="#linguistics">Linguistics</a> checks. He can reroll a check against one of these skills, but must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. He can reroll one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar</strong>: At 2nd level, a sea singer acquires an exotic pet—a monkey or parrot (treat as raven)—that gains abilities as a wizard's familiar, using the sea singer's bard level as his wizard level. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Legs (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a sea singer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against air and water effects and effects that would cause the sea singer to slip, trip, or otherwise be knocked prone. He gains a +2 bonus to CMD against grapple, overrun, and trip. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
<h1 id="street-performer">Street Performer</h1>
<p>Whether acrobat, troubadour, or thespian, the street performer mixes with the masses, singing for his supper.</p>
<p><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: A street performer gains the following types of bardic performance.</p>
<p><em>Disappearing Act (Su)</em>: A street performer can use performance to divert attention from an ally. All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) treat one creature chosen by the bard as if it were <em>invisible</em>. This performance affects one additional creature at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. If the targets take any action that would cause them to become visible, they become visible to everyone. The bard cannot use this ability on himself. This ability is a mind-affecting effect that requires visual components. This performance replaces inspire courage.</p>
<p><em>Harmless Performer (Su)</em>: At 3rd level, a street performer can use performance to appear meek and unworthy of being attacked. While using this performance, whenever an enemy targets the street performer, the enemy must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) or be unable to attack the bard this round, as per <em><a href="#sanctuary">sanctuary</a></em>. The enemy loses the attack that targeted the bard, but may spend additional attacks targeting other creatures. If the opponent was targeting the street performer with a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check at the same DC or lose the spell. If this check succeeds, it may target another creature with the spell instead. This mind-affecting ability requires audible or visual components. This performance replaces inspire competence.</p>
<p><em>Madcap Prank (Su)</em>: At 9th level, a street performer can use performance to discomfit a target within 30 feet, causing its clothing to become tangled, its headgear to fall down over its eyes, or even causing it to slip and fall or otherwise be made to appear a fool. The target must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) each round that it hears or sees the performance, or it takes one of the following random effects each round: 1—blinded, 2—dazzled, 3—deafened, 4—entangled, 5—fall prone, 6—nauseated. Each effect lasts 1 round. This performance replaces inspire greatness.</p>
<p><em>Slip through the Crowd (Su)</em>: At 15th level, a street performer's disappearing act enables affected creatures to move through crowd squares and enemy-occupied squares without impediment. Affected creatures are treated as if having <em><a href="#invisibility-greater">greater invisibility</a></em>, but enemies gain a new saving throw to notice them each time they are attacked. This performance replaces inspire heroics.</p>
<p><strong>Gladhanding</strong>: A street performer earns double the normal amount of money from <a href="#perform">Perform</a> checks. As a standard action, he may use a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> check in place of a <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check to improve a creature's attitude for 1 minute, after which its attitude becomes one step worse than originally. This ability replaces countersong.</p>
<p><strong>Streetwise</strong>: A street performer gains a bonus equal to half his level on <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a>, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local), and <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> checks, <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> or <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks made to influence crowds, and <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks to gather information (minimum +1). This replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Change (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a street performer can don a disguise as a standard action by taking a –5 penalty on his check. He can take 10 on <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> checks and use <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> to create a diversion to hide as a swift action. He can take 20 on a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> check once per day, plus one time per six levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
<p>Cleric</p>
<h1 id="cleric">Cleric</h1>
<p>Clerics are messengers and servants of the gods, venturing forth into the world to spread their patrons' gospel through compassion, reason, bargaining, or righteous conquest. They are the bearers of divine guidance—and divine wrath. From gentle and penitent village priests to holy warriors and church heads whose decrees can rock nations and foment upheaval across entire worlds, clerics are everywhere, their callings and methods as varied as the gods they serve. They are living proof of the gods' power and interest in the world of mortals, and to deny them is to invite destruction, both in this world and the next.</p>
<h1 id="subdomains">Subdomains</h1>
<p>Presented in the section below are new rules for subdomains—more specific focuses for clerical worship and power that allow players greater flexibility in customizing their characters. Every domain has a number of subdomains associated with it (see <a href="#table-2-11:-subdomains">Table: Subdomains</a> for a complete list). Each subdomain replaces a granted power and a number of spells in the domain's granted spell list. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) are detailed in Chapter 5 of this book. A cleric who chooses a subdomain must have access to both the domain and its subdomain from her deity. If a cleric selects a subdomain, she cannot select its associated domain as her other domain choice (in effect, the subdomain replaces its associated domain). Subdomains are treated as equivalent to their associated domain for any effect or prerequisite based on domains. If a subdomain has two associated domains, the cleric can only select the subdomain for one of her domains. Subdomains can be selected by Druids (except the metal subdomain) and inquisitors (if their deity allows it).</p>
<p>If a subdomain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's cleric level + her Wisdom modifier.</p>

<p>Druid</p>
<h1 id="druid">Druid</h1>
<p>Druids are the keepers of the wildlands, the guardians watching at nature's border to ensure that hubristic civilization does not overreach its bounds. From the highest mountain peaks to the steaming jungles and seas, druids learn and draw their power from their surrounding environment and the creatures that live there. Like nature itself, druids can be gentle and succoring or red in tooth and claw, and need answer only to the wind and the rain.</p>
<p>Presented below are new variant class rules to help you customize your druid for specific terrain types, as well as rules for druidic shamans who worship specific totem animals.</p>
<h1 id="aquatic-druid">Aquatic Druid</h1>

This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., <em><a href="#black-tentacles">black tentacles</a></em>, <em><a href="#crushing-hand">crushing hand</a></em>). She never takes pressure damage from deep water. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
<h1 id="arctic-druid">Arctic Druid</h1>

<h1 id="blight-druid">Blight Druid</h1>
<p>The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster.

<h1 id="cave-druid">Cave Druid</h1>

<p><strong>Cavesense (Ex)</strong>: A underground druid adds <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) rather than <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) as a class skill and gains a +2 bonus on <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> skill checks.

When in ooze form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.</p>
<h1 id="desert-druid">Desert Druid</h1>
<p>Not all climates are verdant paradises, but even in the sere deserts there is life—though often hidden from the sun and rarely friendly—and raw, desolate beauty.

<h1 id="jungle-druid">Jungle Druid</h1>

<p>From dockside brawlers to legendary champions, poor foot soldiers to the greatest duelists of the nobility, fighters are those who devote themselves wholeheartedly to the art of combat. While barbarians tap into raw fury in battle, fighters know that the mind is the keenest weapon, and they use theirs to great effect, mastering numerous armaments and fighting styles in a never-ending quest to be the last warrior standing.</p>
<p>Presented below are a number of common martial themes, complete with variant class abilities to help customize characters to their chosen fighting style.</p>
<h1 id="archer">Archer</h1>

<h1 id="free-hand-fighter">Free Hand Fighter</h1>
<p>The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block, tip, and distract his opponents.

This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
<p><strong>Reversal (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm combat maneuver against a creature he threatens as an immediate action when he is the target of a melee attack from another creature. If successful, the attack changes to target the target of the free hand fighter's maneuver instead of the free hand fighter himself. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
<h1 id="mobile-fighter">Mobile Fighter</h1>

<p><strong>Pole Fighting (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets.

<p>Trained under great masters who preached the simple truth that two are better than one when it comes to weapons, the two-weapon warrior is a terror when his hands are full. From paired daggers to exotic double weapons, all combinations come equally alive in his skilled hands.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Flurry (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, when a two-weapon warrior makes a full attack with both weapons, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against melee attacks until the beginning of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 every four levels after 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Twin Blades (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a two-weapon warrior gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when making a full attack with two weapons or a double weapon. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
<p><strong>Doublestrike (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a two-weapon warrior may, as a standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Balance (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, the attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by –1 for a two-weapon warrior. Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
<p><strong>Equal Opportunity (Ex)</strong>: At 13th level, when a two-weapon warrior makes an attack of opportunity, he may attack once with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Balance (Ex)</strong>: At 15th level, the penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by an additional –1 for a two-weapon warrior. This benefit stacks with improved balance. If he is using a one-handed weapon in his off hand, treating it as a light weapon, he uses the normal light weapon penalties. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
<p><strong>Deft Doublestrike (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, when a two-weapon warrior hits an opponent with both weapons, he can make a disarm or sunder attempt (or trip, if one or both weapons can be used to trip) against that opponent as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, when a two-weapon warrior makes a full attack with both weapons, every creature that hits him with a melee attack before the beginning of his next turn provokes an attack of opportunity from the warrior. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
<h1 id="weapon-master">Weapon Master</h1>
<p>Devoted to the perfection of a single weapon, the weapon master's meditations upon his favored weapon border on the obsessive, but none can deny his consummate skill. The weapon master must select a single type of weapon (such as longsword or shortbow). All of his abilities apply to that weapon type.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Guard (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus to CMD against disarm and sunder attempts while wielding his chosen weapon. This bonus also applies on saves against any effect that targets his chosen weapon (for example, <em><a href="#grease">grease</a>, <a href="#heat-metal">heat metal</a>, <a href="#shatter">shatter</a>, <a href="#warp-wood">warp wood</a></em>). The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Training (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with his chosen weapon. The bonus improves by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a weapon master may reroll an attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, miss chance check, or damage roll as an immediate action. He must accept the second roll even if it is worse. He can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every five levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror Move (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a weapon master gains his weapon training bonus as an insight bonus to AC when attacked by his chosen weapon. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Critical (Ex)</strong>: At 13th level, when a weapon master confirms a critical hit with his chosen weapon, he can increase the weapon's damage multiplier by +1 as an immediate action. He can use this ability once per day at 13th level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels above 13th. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Specialist (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, the save DCs of any effects caused by a critical hit with a weapon master's chosen weapon increase by +4. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
<p><strong>Unstoppable Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, a weapon master can take a standard action to make one attack with his chosen weapon as a touch attack that ignores damage reduction (or hardness, if attacking an object). This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
<p>Monk</p>
<h1 id="monk">Monk</h1>
<p>Monks are martial mystics. Through mediation and discipline, and sometimes by way of secrets passed down for generations within a monastery, a monk progresses toward his perfect self—along the way turning his body into an astonishing fighting machine. But though some masters would lead their students to think otherwise, the path toward the perfect self isn't set. Different monks confront the road to enlightenment in different ways, and sometimes even with different goals, from harmony with the universe to physical perfection and immortality.</p>
<p>The themes and alternate class features presented below introduce not only variations in fighting techniques, but alternate philosophies for monks seeking perfection.</p>
<p>Bonus feats marked with asterisks (*) are found in the feat section of this book.</p>
<h1 id="drunken-master">Drunken Master</h1>
<p>Most monks lead lives of moderation and quiet contemplation. But the drunken master finds perfection through excess. Powered by strong wine, he uses his intoxication to reach a state where his <em>ki</em> is more potent, if somewhat fleeting. A drunken master has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Drunken <em>Ki</em> (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a drunken master can drink a tankard of ale or strong alcohol and gain one temporary <em>ki</em> point. The act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The monk can have a maximum number of drunken <em>ki</em> points equal to 1 plus one additional point for every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, and so on). The monk can gain this temporary <em>ki</em> even before he gains a <em>ki</em> pool at 4th level. These drunken <em>ki</em> points last for 1 hour or until spent, whichever is shorter. As long as he has at least 1 drunken <em>ki</em> point, the monk can spend 1 <em>ki</em> point as a swift action to move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces still mind.</p>
<p><strong>Drunken Strength (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a drunken master can spend 1 point of <em>ki</em> as a swift action to inflict 1d6 extra points of damage on a single successful melee attack. The monk can choose to apply the damage after the attack roll is made. At 10th level, the monk may spend 2 drunken <em>ki</em> points to increase the extra damage to 2d6. At 15th level, the monk may spend 3 drunken <em>ki</em> points to increase the extra damage to 3d6. At 20th level, the monk may spend 4 drunken <em>ki</em> points to increase the extra damage to 4d6. The monk must have at least 1 drunken <em>ki</em> point to use this ability. This ability replaces purity of body.</p>
<p><strong>Drunken Courage (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a drunken master is immune to fear as long as he has at least 1 point of drunken <em>ki</em>. This ability replaces diamond body.</p>
<p><strong>Drunken Resilience (Ex)</strong>: At 13th level, a drunken master gains DR 1/— as long as he has at least 1 point of drunken <em>ki</em>. At 16th level, the DR increases to 2/—. At 19th level, it increases to 3/—. This ability replaces diamond soul.</p>
<p><strong>Firewater Breath (Su)</strong>: At 19th level, a drunken master can take a drink and expel a gout of alcohol-fueled fire in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the cone take 20d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier) halves the damage. Using this ability is a standard action that consumes 4 <em>ki</em> points from the monk's <em>ki</em> pool. The monk must have at least 1 drunken <em>ki</em> point to use this ability. This ability replaces empty body.</p>
<h1 id="hungry-ghost-monk">Hungry Ghost Monk</h1>
<p>The hungry ghost monk looks to spirits that prey upon the living as models of perfection. He sees the life energy of the universe as a resource to be manipulated, even stealing it from other creatures. It is through this constant influx of energy that the hungry ghost monk reaches his ultimate goal: power—personal, pure, and simple. A hungry ghost monk has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#punishing-kick-(combat)">Punishing Kick</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a hungry ghost monk gains <a href="#punishing-kick-(combat)">Punishing Kick</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, the monk can push the target of his <a href="#punishing-kick-(combat)">Punishing Kick</a> an additional 5 feet (10 feet at 10th level, 15 feet at 15th level, and 20 feet at 20th level). At 15th level, he can instead choose to push the target 5 feet and knock the target prone with the same attack. The target still gets a saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. This ability replaces <a href="#stunning-fist">Stunning Fist</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Steal <em>Ki</em> (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal <em>ki</em> from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature's<em>ki</em>. This ability replenishes 1 spent <em>ki</em> point to the monk's <em>ki</em> pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 <em>ki</em> point in his pool. He cannot exceed his <em>ki</em> pool's maximum. At 11th level, each time the monk successfully steals <em>ki</em>, he can make an immediate saving throw against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw. The monk gains a bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier on the saving throw. This ability replaces purity of body.</p>
<p><strong>Life Funnel (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal a creature's life force to replenish his own. If the monk has at least 1 <em>ki</em> point in his <em>ki</em> pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal <em>ki</em>, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability cannot steal both <em>ki</em>and hit points at the same time. This ability replaces wholeness of body.</p>
<p><strong>Life from a Stone (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal <em>ki</em> or life force from any creature, not just living creatures. If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool, he gains the benefit of life funnel and steal <em>ki</em> when he confirms a critical hit against any creature or reduces any creature to 0 or fewer hit points. This ability replaces diamond body.</p>
<p><strong>Sipping Demon (Su)</strong>: A 13th level, a hungry ghost monk gains 1 temporary hit point each time he hits an enemy with a melee attack. The monk gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his Wisdom modifier when he scores a critical hit. The maximum number of temporary hit points the monk can have is equal to his monk level. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. The monk can only use this ability when he has at least 1 <em>ki</em> point in his <em>ki</em> pool. This ability is a proscribed manipulation of <em>ki</em> considered by many good monks to be a corruption. The ability replaces diamond soul.</p>
<h1 id="ki-mystic">Ki Mystic</h1>
<p>The <em>ki</em>mystic believes that violence is sometimes necessary, but knowing and understanding is the true root of perfection. Through meditation and spiritual visions, a <em>ki</em>mystic can see beyond the veil of reality to the underlying truth of all existence. A <em>ki</em>mystic has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki</em> Mystic (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a <em>ki</em>mystic gains a pool of <em>ki</em> points equal to his Wisdom modifier. The pool increases to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier + 2 at level 4. If the monk has at least 1 point of <em>ki</em> in his <em>ki</em> pool, he gains a +2 bonus on all <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill checks. As a swift action, the monk can spend 1 <em>ki</em> point immediately before making an ability, or skill check to gain a +4 insight bonus on the check. This ability replaces still mind.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic Insight (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a <em>ki</em>mystic becomes apt at giving just the right word of advice in just the nick of time. As an immediate action, the monk can spend 2 <em>ki</em> points to grant an ally within 30 feet the ability to reroll a single attack roll or saving throw. The ally must be able to hear the monk to gain the reroll benefit. This ability replaces purity of body.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic Visions (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a <em>ki</em>mystic may receive mystic visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk's mind. The effect is similar to a <em><a href="#divination">divination</a></em>spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The <em><a href="#divination">divination</a></em> has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 <em>ki</em> points that are removed from the next day's total. This ability replaces diamond body.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic Prescience (Su)</strong>: At 13th level, a <em>ki</em>mystic gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +4. This ability replaces diamond soul.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic Persistence (Su)</strong>: At 19th level, a <em>ki</em>mystic can create an aura once per day as a swift action at the cost of at least 2 points of <em>ki.</em> The aura emanates out to a 20-foot radius. The monk and all allies within the aura can roll two dice when making an attack roll or a saving throw and take the better result. The aura lasts for 1 round, plus an additional round for every 2 <em>ki</em> points spent when the monk created the aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action, but the <em>ki</em> points for the full duration of the aura are lost. This ability replaces empty body.</p>
<h1 id="monk-of-the-empty-hand">Monk of the Empty Hand</h1>
<p>The monk of the empty hand eschews normal weapons in favor of whatever is lying around—rocks, chair legs, flagons of ale, even a simple quill pen all become deadly weapons in the hands of such a monk. A monk of the empty hand draws on his own <em>ki</em> to infuse his improvised weapons with power, and can transform a broken bottle into a magical weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Monks of the empty hand are proficient with the shuriken only. A monk of the empty hand treats normal weapons as improvised weapons with the following equivalencies (substituting all of their statistics for the listed weapon): a light weapon functions as a light hammer, a one-handed weapon functions as a club, and a two-handed weapon functions as a quarterstaff. This replaces the normal monk weapon proficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Flurry of Blows (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 1st level, a monk of the empty hand can make a flurry of blows using any combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with an improvised weapon. He may not make a flurry of blows with any other weapons, including special monk weapons. A monk of the empty hand's flurry of blows otherwise functions as normal for a monk of his level.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: A monk of the empty hand adds the following feats to his list of bonus feats at 6th level: <a href="#improved-dirty-trick-(combat)">Improved Dirty Trick*</a>, <a href="#improved-steal-(combat)">Improved Steal*</a>, and <a href="#improvised-weapon-mastery">Improvised Weapon Mastery</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Improvisation (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, as a swift action, a monk of the empty hand may use an improvised weapon to deal damage as if it were another type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) for 1 round, regardless of the weapon's normal damage type. This ability replaces still mind.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki</em> Pool (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, in addition to the normal abilities of his <em>ki</em> pool, a monk of the empty hand may spend 1 point from his <em>ki</em> pool to increase the range increment for an improvised thrown weapon or shuriken by 20 feet for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki</em> Weapons (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a monk of the empty hand may spend 1 point from his <em>ki</em> pool as a swift action to deal damage equal to his unarmed strike damage with an improvised weapon for 1 round. At 11th level, the monk may spend <em>ki</em> to grant an enhancement bonus or magical weapon abilities to an improvised weapon for 1 round, at the rate of 1 point of <em>ki</em> per +1 bonus or its equivalent. The monk may not spend more than 3 points of <em>ki</em> at one time for this purpose. For example, a monk can spend 2 points of <em>ki</em> to give his improvised weapon a +1 enhancement bonus and the <em><a href="#weapons-ki-focus">ki focus</a></em> quality, or just the <em><a href="#weapons-flaming-burst">flaming burst</a></em> quality. At 15th level, the limit increases to 5 <em>ki</em> per round. The monk may use this ability to add magical weapon qualities to improvised weapons that could not normally have such a quality, such as adding the <em><a href="#weapons-disruption">disruption</a></em> quality to a slashing weapon, or the <em><a href="#vorpal">vorpal</a></em> quality to a bludgeoning weapon. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body.</p>
<h1 id="monk-of-the-four-winds">Monk of the Four Winds</h1>
<p>The monk of the four winds is connected to the natural world in a way few other creatures—even other monks—can hope to match. He can call upon the elements and the spirits of the world in times of need, and as he nears his goal of perfection, he gains the ability to slow down time and even defeat death itself. A monk of the four winds has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#elemental-fist-(combat)">Elemental Fist</a> (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a monk of the four winds gains <a href="#elemental-fist-(combat)">Elemental Fist</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, the monk increases the damage of his <a href="#elemental-fist-(combat)">Elemental Fist</a> by 1d6 (2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and so on). This ability replaces <a href="#stunning-fist">Stunning Fist</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Time (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, a monk of the four winds can use his <em>ki</em> to slow time or quicken his movements, depending on the observer. As a swift action, the monk can expend 6 <em>ki</em> points to gain three standard actions during his turn instead of just one. The monk can use these actions to do the following: take a melee attack action, use a skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action. The monk cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, and cannot combine them to take full-attack actions. Any move actions the monk makes this turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces abundant step.</p>
<p><strong>Aspect Master (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, a monk of the four winds must choose an aspect of one of the great spirits of the world. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. This spirit grants the monk a new appearance and new abilities, as well as changing or augmenting the monk's personality in some way. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The monk must abide by the alignment restrictions of the aspect. If the monk ever changes his alignment to something outside the aspect's alignment restrictions, he loses this ability and cannot regain it unless his alignment later changes again to match that of the aspect. This ability replaces timeless body.</p>
<p><em>Aspect of the Carp</em>: The monk's skin becomes a coat of golden, iridescent fish scales, his neck grows gills, and his fingers become webbed. He can breathe water and gains a swim speed equal to his land speed. The carp is heroic and adventurous—a monk must be nonevil to take on the aspect of the carp.</p>
<p><em>Aspect of the Ki-Rin</em>: The monk's skin takes on a golden luminescence, and a silvery mane that cannot be bound grows atop his head. He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed, but he must end each turn on the ground. If the monk does not land by the end of his turn, he falls from whatever height he has attained. The ki-rin is honorable, honest, and self-sacrificing—a monk must be lawful good to take on the aspect of the ki-rin.</p>
<p><em>Aspect of the Monkey</em>: The monk's face becomes that of a monkey, and he grows a prehensile tail. The monk can pick up objects and make unarmed attacks with his tail (though the tail does not grant additional unarmed attacks or natural attacks). In addition, the monk gains a climb speed equal to his land speed. The monkey is a creature of whimsy and a lover of pranks—a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the monkey.</p>
<p><em>Aspect of the Oni</em>: The monk's skin becomes pitch black, and his hair turns white, black, red, or violet. He can assume <em><a href="#gaseous-form">gaseous form</a></em> (as the spell) as a standard action for 1 minute per day per monk level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The oni is treacherous and deceitful, and it hungers for the pain and death of living creatures—a monk must be evil to take on the aspect of the oni.</p>
<p><em>Aspect of the Owl</em>: The monk grows feathers, and his head becomes avian, with wide, unblinking eyes. He gains a fly speed of 30 feet. The owl is a sage creature, deeply serious, and driven toward a single goal—a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the owl.</p>
<p><em>Aspect of the Tiger</em>: Dark stripes appear on the monk's skin, and his face becomes more feline. His eyes become catlike, with vertical pupils, and his canines enlarge. Once per hour, the monk can move at 10 times his normal land speed when he makes a charge and is treated as if he had the pounce ability. The tiger is swift, fierce, and deadly—a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the tiger.</p>
<p><strong>Immortality (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, a monk of the four winds no longer ages. He remains in his current age category forever. Even if the monk comes to a violent end, he spontaneously <em>reincarnates</em>(as the spell) 24 hours later in a place of his choosing within 20 miles of the place he died. The monk must have visited the place in which he returns back to life at least once. This ability replaces perfect self.</p>
<h1 id="monk-of-the-healing-hand">Monk of the Healing Hand</h1>
<p>Monks of the healing hand seek perfection through helping others. By focusing their meditations on the flow of life within themselves and all creation they gain an understanding of how to share their <em>ki</em> with others, healing wounds and even bringing the dead back to life. For such a monk, sacrificing himself to save another is the surest way to achieve transcendence. A monk of the healing hand has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Healing Hand (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a monk of the healing hand can heal another creature's wounds with a touch. As a full-round action, the monk can spend 2 <em>ki</em> points to heal a number of hit points equal to the monk's level. He needs at least one hand free to use this ability, and cannot heal himself. If the action is interrupted, the subject heals no hit points, and the <em>ki</em> points are lost. This ability replaces wholeness of body.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki</em> Sacrifice (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a monk of the healing hand can use his entire <em>ki</em> pool to bring a person back to life. It takes 1 hour to perform this ritual. At the end of the ritual, the monk sacrifices all of his<em>ki</em>in order to cast <em><a href="#raise-dead">raise dead</a></em> (as the spell) with a caster level equal to his monk level. The ritual uses all of the <em>ki</em> in the monk's <em>ki</em> pool; the monk must have at least 6 points of <em>ki</em> in his <em>ki</em> pool to use this ability. At 15th level, the monk may sacrifice his <em>ki</em> to cast <em><a href="#resurrection">resurrection</a></em>. The monk must have at least 8 points of <em>ki</em> in his <em>ki</em> pool to use this ability. These rituals do not require material components. When this ability is used, the monk's <em>ki</em> pool is not replenished until 24 hours have passed. This ability replaces both diamond body and quivering palm.</p>
<p><strong>True Sacrifice (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, in a final selfless act, a monk of the healing hand can draw in his entire <em>ki</em>, which then explodes outward in a 50-foot-radius emanation. All dead allies within the emanation are brought back to life, as if they were the subject of a <em><a href="#true-resurrection">true resurrection</a></em> spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. When the monk does this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed in this way can never come back to life, not even by way of a <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em> or <em><a href="#miracle">miracle</a></em> spell or by the power of a deity. Furthermore, the monk's name can never be spoken or written down again. All written mentions of his name become nothing more than a blank space. This ability replaces perfect self.</p>
<h1 id="monk-of-the-lotus">Monk of the Lotus</h1>
<p>Monks are warriors who hone their bodies into deadly weapons, but some monks eschew violence in favor of a more peaceful philosophy. While a monk of the lotus realizes that combat cannot always be avoided—and is more than capable in a fight—he understands that all creatures are connected, and to harm another is to harm the self. Instead, he strives to find peaceful resolutions to conflicts, and in doing so, hopes to achieve inner peace. A monk of the lotus has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#touch-of-serenity-(combat)">Touch of Serenity</a> (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a monk of the lotus gains <a href="#touch-of-serenity-(combat)">Touch of Serenity</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, the duration of <a href="#touch-of-serenity-(combat)">Touch of Serenity</a> increases by 1 round. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new Will save to end the effect. This duration does not stack; only the longest remaining duration applies. This ability replaces <a href="#stunning-fist">Stunning Fist</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Touch of Surrender (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, a monk of the lotus makes a foe into a friend with a single show of mercy. As an immediate action, when one of his melee attacks would reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the monk can spend 6 <em>ki</em> points to make the target of that attack surrender. When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast <em><a href="#charm-monster">charm monster</a></em> with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of surrender at a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability replaces abundant step.</p>
<p><strong>Touch of Peace (Su)</strong>: At 15th level, a monk of the lotus can set up vibrations within the body of another creature to win over the creature's mind. The monk can use touch of peace once per day, and must announce his intent before making his attack roll. On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage, but the target is charmed as if the monk had cast <em><a href="#charm-monster">charm monster</a></em> with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creature is charmed for 1 day per level. If the monk or his allies attack the charmed creature, or if the monk asks or commands the charmed creature to take hostile actions, the effect ends. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability replaces quivering palm.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Master (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, a monk of the lotus gains all <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skills and the <a href="#linguistics">Linguistics</a> skill as class skills. The monk uses Wisdom instead of Intelligence as the key ability for these skills. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and the moon.</p>
<h1 id="monk-of-the-sacred-mountain">Monk of the Sacred Mountain</h1>
<p>The monk of the sacred mountain finds strength and power in the earth beneath his feet. Rather than spinning though the battlefield with the fluid motion of the river, he roots himself to the ground, as immovable and unshakable as the stones of the mountain. A monk of the sacred mountain has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Monk (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a monk of the sacred mountain gains <a href="#toughness">Toughness</a> as a bonus feat. In addition, the monk gains a +1 natural armor bonus. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Bastion Stance (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a monk of the sacred mountain becomes like stone, nearly impossible to move when he stands his ground. If the monk starts and ends his turn in the same space, he cannot be knocked prone or forcibly moved until the start of his next turn, except by mind-affecting or teleportation effects. At 16th level, he is immune to any attempts to force him to move, even mind-affecting and teleportation effects. This ability replaces slow fall.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Limb Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a monk of the sacred mountain can deflect blows with an active defense that complements his bastion stance. If the monk starts and ends his turn in the same space, he gains a +2 shield bonus to AC and CMD until the start of his next turn. As a swift action, he can spend 1 <em>ki</em> point to increase this bonus to +4. This ability replaces high jump.</p>
<p><strong>Adamantine Monk (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a monk of the sacred mountain has muscles so strong and skin so resilient that he gains DR 1/—. This DR increases by 1 for every three levels thereafter. As a swift action, the monk can spend 1 <em>ki</em> point to double his DR until the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Vow of Silence (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, a monk of the sacred mountain becomes as impassive as stone, making a vow of silence in exchange for greater abilities. The monk gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD and a +4 bonus on <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a>, and <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks. The monk does not lose the capacity for speech, but if he ever speaks, he loses this feature for 24 hours. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and the moon.</p>
<h1 id="weapon-adept">Weapon Adept</h1>
<p>While all monks train in both unarmed combat and with weapons, the weapon adept seeks to become one with his weapons, transforming them into perfect extensions of his own body. Through such training, a weapon adept seeks to attain perfection by becoming a living weapon himself. A weapon adept has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#perfect-strike-(combat)">Perfect Strike</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a weapon adept gains <a href="#perfect-strike-(combat)">Perfect Strike</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 10th level, the monk can roll his attack roll three times and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, he can choose which one of his other two rolls to use as his confirmation roll. This ability replaces <a href="#stunning-fist">Stunning Fist</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Way of the Weapon Master (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a weapon adept gains <a href="#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat with one of his monk weapons. At 6th level, the monk gains <a href="#weapon-specialization">Weapon Specialization</a> with the same weapon as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, the monk gains evasion. This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Initiative (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, a weapon adept does not need to roll for initiative. He always treats his initiative roll as if it resulted in any number of his choosing (from 1 to 20). This ability replaces timeless body.</p>
<p><strong>Pure Power</strong>: At 20th level, a weapon adept forsakes the ideals of the perfect self to become a bastion of the physical and mental virtues monks hold dear. The monk gains a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom. This ability replaces perfect self.</p>
<h1 id="zen-archer">Zen Archer</h1>
<p>Some monks seek to become one with another weapon entirely—the bow. The zen archer takes a weapon most other monks eschew and seeks perfection in the pull of a taut bowstring, the flex of a bow's limbs, and the flight of an arrow fired true.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Zen archers are proficient with longbows, shortbows, composite longbows, and composite shortbows in addition to their normal weapon proficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Flurry of Blows (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 1st level, a zen archer can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action, but only when using a bow (even though it is a ranged weapon). He may not make a flurry of blows with his unarmed attacks or any other weapons. A zen archer does not apply his Strength bonus on damage rolls made with flurry of blows unless he is using a composite bow with a Strength rating. A zen archer's flurry of blows otherwise functions as normal for a monk of his level.</p>
<p>A zen archer cannot use <a href="#rapid-shot">Rapid Shot</a> or <a href="#manyshot">Manyshot</a> when making a flurry of blows with his bow.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: A zen archer's bonus feats must be taken from the following list: <a href="#combat-reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="#deflect-arrows">Deflect Arrows</a>, <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="#far-shot">Far Shot</a>, <a href="#point-blank-shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="#precise-shot">Precise Shot</a>, and <a href="#rapid-shot">Rapid Shot</a>. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: <a href="#focused-shot-(combat)">Focused Shot*</a>, <a href="#improved-precise-shot">Improved Precise Shot</a>, <a href="#manyshot">Manyshot</a>, <a href="#mobility">Mobility</a>, and <a href="#parting-shot-(combat)">Parting Shot*</a>. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: <a href="#improved-critical">Improved Critical</a>, Pinpoint Targeting, <a href="#shot-on-the-run">Shot on the Run</a>, and <a href="#snatch-arrows">Snatch Arrows</a>. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them. These feats replace the monk's normal bonus feats.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#perfect-strike-(combat)">Perfect Strike</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a zen archer gains <a href="#perfect-strike-(combat)">Perfect Strike</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A zen archer can use <a href="#perfect-strike-(combat)">Perfect Strike</a> with any bow. At 10th level, the monk can roll his attack roll three times and take the highest result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the monk must choose one of his other two rolls to use as his confirmation roll. This ability replaces <a href="#stunning-fist">Stunning Fist</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Way of the Bow (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a zen archer gains <a href="#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat with one type of bow. At 6th level, the monk gains <a href="#weapon-specialization">Weapon Specialization</a> with the same weapon as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Zen Archery (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a zen archer may use his Wisdom modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier on ranged attack rolls when using a bow. This ability replaces maneuver training.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#point-blank-master-(combat)">Point Blank Master</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a zen archer gains <a href="#point-blank-master-(combat)">Point Blank Master*</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces still mind.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki</em> Pool (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, in addition to the normal abilities of his <em>ki</em> pool, a zen archer may spend 1 point from his <em>ki</em> pool to increase the range increment for his bow by 50 feet for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki</em> Arrows (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a zen archer may spend 1 point from his <em>ki</em> pool as a swift action to change the damage dice of arrows he shoots to that of his unarmed strikes. This lasts until the start of his next turn. For example, a Medium zen archer's short bow normally deals 1d6 damage; using this ability, his arrows deal 1d8 damage until the start of his next turn. This ability replaces purity of body.</p>
<p><strong>Reflexive Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a zen archer can make attacks of opportunity with arrows from his bow. The monk still threatens squares he could reach with unarmed strikes, and can still only make one attack of opportunity per round (unless he has <a href="#combat-reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>). This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Trick Shot (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a zen archer may hit targets that he might otherwise miss. By spending 1 point from his <em>ki</em> pool as a swift action, the zen archer can ignore concealment. By spending 2 points, he can ignore total concealment or cover. By spending 3 points, he can ignore total cover, even firing arrows around corners. The arrow must still be able to reach the target; a target inside a closed building with no open doors or windows cannot be attacked. These effects last for 1 round. This ability replaces diamond body.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ki Focus</em> Bow (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, as long as he has at least 1 point of <em>ki</em> in his <em>ki</em> pool, a zen archer may treat arrows fired from his bow as if they were <em><a href="#weapons-ki-focus">ki focus</a></em> weapons, allowing him to use his special <em>ki</em> attacks as if his arrows were unarmed attacks. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Paladin</p>
<h1 id="paladin">Paladin</h1>
<p>Holy warriors and defenders of the faith, paladins know that the only thing more abhorrent than an evil creature is a fundamentally good creature too timid to strive against the forces of darkness. Paladins are divine champions, gladly giving their lives in the service of light and justice, asking only that they may protect the innocent and cleanse the world to the best of their ability. Theirs is a hard path, requiring great sacrifice and ultimate devotion to a moral code, yet with her last breath a paladin can take comfort in a life of absolute righteousness.</p>
<p>Presented below are several variant class features to help flesh out common paladin archetypes, the better to customize characters for fighting the good fight.</p>
<h1 id="divine-defender">Divine Defender</h1>
<p>Some paladins see themselves as the last line of defense between the teeming hordes of evil and the innocent folk trying to make a living in a harsh, unforgiving world. These defenders spend their lives protecting others and taking on foes that the common man should not even know exist. To aid them in their holy mission, they have special powers to protect themselves and those around them. The divine defender has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Defense (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy <em><a href="#armor-fortification">fortification</a></em> armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Bond (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7): <em><a href="#champion">champion</a></em>*, <em><a href="#weapons-ghost-touch">ghost touch</a>, heavy <a href="#armor-fortification">fortification</a>, <a href="#armor-invulnerability">invulnerability</a>, <a href="#light">light</a> <a href="#armor-fortification">fortification</a>, moderate <a href="#armor-fortification">fortification</a>, <a href="#armor-spell-resistance">spell resistance</a></em>(13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15–4 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: <em><a href="#armor-energy-resistance">energy resistance</a></em>for +3 bonus, <em>improved <a href="#armor-energy-resistance">energy resistance</a></em> for +5 bonus, or <em><a href="#righteous">righteous</a></em>* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
<p>If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<h1 id="hospitaler">Hospitaler</h1>
<p>Paladins are known for their charity and for tending to the sick. The hospitaler takes to this calling above all others, spending much of her time healing the poor, and giving aid and succor to those in need. The hospitaler has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Evil (Su)</strong>: This functions as the paladin ability, but the hospitaler can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels thereafter).</p>
<p><strong>Channel Positive Energy (Su)</strong>: When a hospitaler reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric equal to her paladin level –3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability does not expend uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins. This replaces the standard paladin's channel positive energy ability.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Healing (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use of her channel positive energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal to her paladin level. Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any afflictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the affliction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times. This ability replaces aura of justice.</p>
<h1 id="sacred-servant">Sacred Servant</h1>
<p>Paladins as a general rule, venerate the gods of good and purity, but some take this a step further, dedicating themselves to a specific deity and furthering the cause of the faith. These sacred servants are rewarded for their devotion with additional spells and powerful allies. A sacred servant must select one deity to worship. This deity's alignment must be lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good. A sacred servant has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Evil (Su)</strong>: This functions as the paladin ability, but the sacred servant can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels thereafter). This replaces smite evil.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: At 4th level, when a sacred servant gains the ability to cast spells, she also chooses one domain associated with her deity. Her effective cleric level for this domain is equal to her paladin level –3. In addition, she also gains one domain spell slot for each level of paladin spells she can cast. Every day she must prepare the domain spell from her chosen domain in that spell slot.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Bond (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
<p>If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred servant takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Call Celestial Ally (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast <em><a href="#planar-ally-lesser">lesser planar ally</a></em> once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves to <em><a href="#planar-ally">planar ally</a></em> and at 16th level, this improves to <em><a href="#planar-ally-greater">greater planar ally</a></em>. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level. This ability replaces aura of resolve.</p>
<h1 id="shining-knight">Shining Knight</h1>
<p>While paladins often are seen mounted atop a loyal steed, the shining knight is the true symbol of mounted bravery. They are never far from their steeds and are always clad in brightly polished armor. The shining knight has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Rider (Ex and Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a shining knight does not take any penalty to her <a href="#ride">Ride</a> skill due to her armor check penalty. In addition, any mount she is riding gains the benefit of her divine grace class feature, adding her Charisma bonus (if any) to its saving throws. This ability replaces divine health.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Bond (Su)</strong>: Upon reaching 5th level, a shining knight must form a bond with a mount. This ability otherwise functions as the paladin ability.</p>
<p><strong>Knight's Charge (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, whenever a mounted shining knight charges a foe, her movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, for either her or her mount. In addition, if her target is also the target of her smite evil ability and the charge attack hits, the target must make a Will save or be panicked for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shining knight's level. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shining knight's level + the shining knight's Charisma modifier. This ability replaces aura of justice.</p>
<h1 id="undead-scourge">Undead Scourge</h1>
<p>Undead are an abomination in the eyes of the just and righteous. It is no surprise then that there are some paladins that dedicate themselves to wiping these unholy terrors from the world. The following are the class features of the undead scourge.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Evil (Su)</strong>: This functions as the paladin ability of the same name, but the undead scourge does not deal 2 points of damage per level on the first successful attack against evil dragons and evil outsiders. She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made against evil undead creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Life (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, an undead scourge emits a 10-foot aura of life around her that weakens undead creatures. Undead in this aura take a –4 penalty on Will saves made to resist positive energy. In addition, undead in this aura do not regain hit points from channeled negative energy. This ability replaces aura of resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Undead Annihilation (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead creature. If this attack hits, the undead creature must make a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the undead scourge's level + the undead scourge's Charisma modifier. Undead with twice as many Hit Dice as the undead scourge are unaffected by this ability. If the attack misses, the smite evil is wasted without effect. This ability replaces aura of justice.</p>
<h1 id="warrior-of-the-holy-light">Warrior of the Holy Light</h1>
<p>Some paladins use their gifts to focus on the holy light that shines within their souls. With the gifts of purity and redemption, these paladins spend much of their lives helping others find the true path. Unleashing this power takes patience and comes at a steep price. Warriors of the holy light have the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Power of Faith (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items.</p>
<p>At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can spend a use of her lay on hands ability to call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of <em><a href="#light">light</a></em> to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute.</p>
<p>At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell <em><a href="#restoration-lesser">lesser restoration</a></em>. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day.</p>
<p>At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as <em><a href="#daylight">daylight</a></em> for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated.</p>
<p>At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as <em><a href="#light">light</a> <a href="#armor-fortification">fortification</a></em>).</p>
<p>At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Shining Light (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can unleash a 30-foot burst of pure, white light as a standard action. Evil creatures within this burst take 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Reflex save halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels. This ability replaces aura of faith.</p>
<h1 id="antipaladin-alternate-class">Antipaladin (Alternate Class)</h1>
<p><em>Not all paladins that fall become antipaladins. In fact, the transformation is quite rare. Most paladins spend months or even years regaining their paladinhood, but they never stray so far from the path as to become irredeemable. Rarely, a paladin turns from the light and seeks instead to make a pact with the dark powers. Often this is through temptation or some sort of ruse, but once the deal is struck, the paladin finds himself on the path to damnation.</em></p>
<p><em>When such a fall occurs, the transformation can be swift. The paladin trades in all of his paladin levels for antipaladin levels on a 1-for-1 basis. This is usually a traumatic experience, involving a complex ritual that involves a living sacrifice and dark oaths made to foul powers (who sometimes send minions to bear witness). Once complete, the anitpaladin emerges, ready to bring ruin to the world.</em></p>
<p><em>It should be noted that not all antipaladins are fallen heroes. Some warriors are trained from a young age to assume the mantle of antipaladin, forged through pain and trauma into exemplars of evil. These cruel warriors know nothing of compassion or loyalty, but they can teach a great deal about pain and suffering.</em></p>
<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses <a href="#table-2-13:-antipaladin">Table: Antipaladin</a> to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2–13.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Chaotic evil.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-5">Class Features</h1>
<p>All of the following are class features of the antipaladin.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Evil (Ex)</strong>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <em><a href="#detect-evil">detect evil</a></em>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
<p><strong>Detect Good (Sp)</strong>: At will, an antipaladin can use <em><a href="#detect-good">detect good</a>,</em>as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
<p><strong>Smite Good (Su)</strong>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2–13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
<p><strong>Unholy Resilience (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>Touch of Corruption (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the <a href="#extra-lay-on-hands">Extra Lay On Hands</a> feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Cowardice (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a –4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Plague Bringer (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
<p><strong>Cruelty (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
<p><em>• Fatigued</em>: The target is fatigued.</p>
<p><em>• Shaken</em>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</p>
<p><em>• Sickened</em>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</p>
<p>At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</p>
<p><em>• Dazed</em>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>• Diseased</em>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <em><a href="#contagion">contagion</a></em>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</p>
<p><em>• Staggered</em>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin.</p>
<p>At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</p>
<p><em>• Cursed</em>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <em><a href="#bestow-curse">bestow curse</a></em>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</p>
<p><em>• Exhausted</em>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</p>
<p><em>• Frightened</em>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</p>
<p><em>• Nauseated</em>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</p>
<p><em>• Poisoned</em>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <em><a href="#poison">poison</a></em>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level.</p>
<p>At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</p>
<p><em>• Blinded</em>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</p>
<p><em>• Deafened</em>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</p>
<p><em>• Paralyzed</em>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>• Stunned</em>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin.</p>
<p>These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Channel Negative Energy (Su)</strong>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2–13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>). When Table 2–13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level –3.</p>
<p><strong>Fiendish Boon (Sp)</strong>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <em><a href="#weapons-anarchic">anarchic</a></em>, <em><a href="#weapons-flaming">flaming</a>, <a href="#weapons-flaming-burst">flaming burst</a>, <a href="#weapons-keen">keen</a>, <a href="#weapons-speed">speed</a>, <a href="#unholy">unholy</a>, <a href="#vicious">vicious</a>, <a href="#vorpal">vorpal</a></em>, and<em><a href="#wounding">wounding</a></em>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15–9 in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <em><a href="#summon-monster-iii">summon monster III</a></em>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <em>summon monster</em> spell increases by one, to a maximum of <em><a href="#summon-monster-ix">summon monster IX</a></em> at 17th level.</p>
<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Despair (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a –2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Vengeance (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Sin (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Depravity (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a –4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><strong>Unholy Champion (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <em><a href="#banishment">banishment</a>,</em>using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <em><a href="#banishment">banishment</a></em>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
<p><strong>Associates</strong>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an <em><a href="#atonement">atonement</a></em>spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end—evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>
<h1 id="ex-antipaladins">Ex-Antipaladins</h1>
<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <em><a href="#atonement">atonement</a></em>spell), as appropriate.</p>
<p>Ranger</p>
<h1 id="ranger">Ranger</h1>
<p>Where the average druid eschews settlements entirely, seeking solace in the wilds, rangers are the border riders, living on civilization's tattered edge. They are the scouts and the bounty hunters, the trackers and woodsmen, and in their chosen environments they are unmatchable. Self-sufficient and keenly aware of their surroundings, rangers surive through strength, wit, and adaptability, stalking their prey and melting into the woods or wastes without a trace. It is this very adapabtibility and staunch, pioneering sense of independence that leads rangers out of more formal society or schooling and into a number of different specializations and combat styles, from two-handed fighting and breathtaking feats of archery to mastery of particular terrains or communication with the beasts around them.</p>
<p>Presented below are a number of alternate class features and archetypes to help customize your ranger, whether he's a bold master of beasts or a shifty forest scout adept at tracking the enemy and picking off the unwary.</p>
<h1 id="new-combat-styles">New Combat Styles</h1>
<p>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of the two core <a href="#combat-style-feat">combat styles</a> or one of the following new combat styles: crossbow, mounted combat, natural weapon, two-handed weapon, or weapon and shield style. The ranger can choose feats from his selected combat style even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow</strong>: If the ranger selects crossbow style, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: <a href="#deadly-aim">Deadly Aim</a>, <a href="#focused-shot-(combat)">Focused Shot</a>, <a href="#precise-shot">Precise Shot</a>, and <a href="#rapid-reload">Rapid Reload</a>. At 6th level, he adds <a href="#crossbow-mastery-(combat)">Crossbow Mastery</a> and <a href="#improved-precise-shot">Improved Precise Shot</a> to the list. At 10th level, he adds<a href="#pinpoint-targeting">Pinpoint Targeting</a> and <a href="#shot-on-the-run">Shot on the Run</a> to the list.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a></strong>: If the ranger selects mounted combat, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: <a href="#mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="#mounted-archery">Mounted Archery</a>, <a href="#ride-by-attack">Ride-By Attack</a>, and <a href="#trick-riding-(combat)">Trick Riding</a>. At 6th level, he adds <a href="#mounted-shield-(combat)">Mounted Shield</a> and <a href="#spirited-charge">Spirited Charge</a> to the list. At 10th level, he adds <a href="#mounted-skirmisher-(combat)">Mounted Skirmisher</a> and <a href="#unseat">Unseat</a> to the list.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Weapon</strong>: If the ranger selects natural weapon style, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: <a href="#aspect-of-the-beast">Aspect of the Beast</a>, <a href="#improved-natural-attack">Improved Natural Weapon</a>, <a href="#rending-claws-(combat)">Rending Claws</a>, and <a href="#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a>. At 6th level, he adds Eldritch Fangs and <a href="#vital-strike">Vital Strike</a> to the list. At 10th level, he adds <a href="#multiattack">Multiattack and</a><a href="#improved-vital-strike">Improved Vital Strike</a> to the list.</p>
<p><strong>Two-Handed Weapon</strong>: If the ranger selects two-handed weapon style, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: <a href="#cleave">Cleave</a>, <a href="#power-attack">Power Attack</a>, <a href="#pushing-assault-(combat)">Pushing Assault</a>, and <a href="#shield-of-swings-(combat)">Shield of Swings</a>. At 6th level, he adds <a href="#furious-focus-(combat)">Furious Focus</a> and <a href="#great-cleave">Great Cleave</a> to the list. At 10th level, he adds <a href="#dreadful-carnage-(combat)">Dreadful Carnage</a> and <a href="#improved-sunder">Improved Sunder</a> to the list.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Shield</strong>: If the ranger selects weapon and shield style, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: <a href="#improved-shield-bash">Improved Shield Bash</a>, <a href="#shield-focus">Shield Focus</a>, <a href="#shield-slam">Shield Slam</a>, and <a href="#two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>. At 6th level, he adds <a href="#saving-shield-(combat)">Saving Shield</a> and <a href="#shield-master">Shield Master</a> to the list. At 10th level, he adds <a href="#bashing-finish-(combat)">Bashing Finish</a> and <a href="#greater-shield-focus">Greater Shield Focus</a> to the list.</p>
<h1 id="beast-master">Beast Master</h1>
<p>Some rangers, particularly those in primitive lands or who were raised by animals, have unusually strong bonds with animals. Unique among rangers, they can bond with multiple animals of any kind, creating a menagerie of wild yet loyal creatures, like a strange family. A beast master has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: A beast master's class skills are <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> (Dex), <a href="#climb">Climb</a> (Str), <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (Int), <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> (Dex), <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> (Cha), <a href="#heal">Heal</a> (Wis), <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) (Int), <a href="#perception">Perception</a> (Wis), <a href="#ride">Ride</a> (Dex), <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> (Dex), <a href="#survival">Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> (Wis). These replace the standard ranger class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex)</strong>: A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level – 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices—he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.</p>
<p>The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Empathic Link (Su)</strong>: The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The ranger's effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
<h1 id="guide">Guide</h1>
<p>Many rangers are loners, but some choose to use their familiarity with the land to guide others safely through the wilderness. The guide forgoes a favored enemy to focus on the task or foe at hand, and can pass his knowledge and luck on to his charges. A guide has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger's Focus (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, once per day, the guide can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That creature remains the ranger's focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the ranger designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of his focus. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.</p>
<p>At 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the ranger can use this ability one additional time per day. This ability replaces favored enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Terrain Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, the guide forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the ranger grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and <a href="#perception">Perception</a>, <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a>, and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the ranger's allies leave no trail and can't be tracked. The ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires. This ability replaces hunter's bond.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger's Luck (Ex)</strong>: Upon reaching 9th level, once per day the guide can either reroll one of his attack rolls or force an enemy who just hit him with an attack to reroll the attack roll. The ranger must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. A ranger can use this ability once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th and 19th levels. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Inspired Moment (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, the guide can have an inspired moment once per day as a free action. The ranger gains the following benefits until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet. He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn. He gains a +4 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks. Finally, he automatically confirms any critical threat he scores. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 19th level. This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Ranger's Luck (Ex)</strong>: Upon reaching 16th level, the ranger's luck increases. He gains a +4 bonus on his rerolls made with the ranger's luck ability, or if he forces an enemy to reroll an attack, that enemy takes a –4 penalty on the roll. This bonus or penalty is also applied on any roll to confirm critical hits. This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
<h1 id="horse-lord">Horse Lord</h1>
<p>Rangers of the plains use horses or other riding beasts to hunt their lands, forging a near-mystical relationship with their mounts. Horse lords are unparalleled mounted combatants, the envy of even the most dedicated cavalier. Though called “horse lords” as a generic term, these rangers are not restricted to horses for their animal companions—any creature the ranger can ride is included in these abilities. A horse lord has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style Feat (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a horse lord must choose the mounted combat style.</p>
<p><strong>Mounted Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an animal he can use as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A Medium ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level – 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> and <a href="#ride">Ride</a> checks with his animal companion mount. This ability replaces hunter's bond.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 12th level, the horse lord strengthens his bond with his mount. The ranger's effective druid level for his mount is now equal to his ranger level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Bond (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, the horse lord can grant his animal companion temporary hit points equal to his ranger level once per day. While these temporary hit points last, when his mount is within 30 feet of the him, he can choose to share the damage taken by his mount as if using <em><a href="#shield-other">shield other</a></em>. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
<h1 id="infiltrator">Infiltrator</h1>
<p>Some rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes' strengths against them. Infiltrators are willing to walk a mile in an enemy's shoes so as to learn eveything there is to know about their foes in order to more effectively hunt and kill them.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an infiltrator learns how to copy the unusual abilities of his prey. He chooses one type of creature he has selected as a favored enemy, such as “aberrations.” The ranger selects one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below). A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with <a href="#skill-focus">Skill Focus</a>), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type's list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he's selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired). The infiltrator can only use one adaptation at a time. This class ability replaces favored terrain.</p>

<h1 id="shapeshifter">Shapeshifter</h1>
<p>Most rangers venture into the wilderness, but there are some who let the wilderness seep into them. Whether by curse, disease, ancient rite, a slight lycanthropic influence in the blood, or the corrupting influence of chaos, these rangers embrace the wild to transform themselves into something untamed and feral. Shapeshifters are often held in awe, but are even more often feared. A shapeshifter has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Style Feat (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a shapeshifter ranger must choose the natural weapon combat style.</p>
<p><strong>Shifter's Blessing (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, the shapeshifter can take on the aspects of a wild creature once per day as a swift action. He can remain in this form for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. While in one of his shifter's blessing forms, the ranger gains the shapeshifter subtype.</p>
<p>The shapeshifter must choose one of the following forms. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Bear</em>: The ranger's muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but his base speed becomes 20 feet.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Cat</em>: The ranger's muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 10 feet, and he gains a +4 bonus on <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="#climb">Climb</a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Dragon</em>: The ranger's skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Eagle</em>: The ranger's skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Jackal</em>: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger can spend a move action to move up to 1/2 his speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Otter</em>: The ranger's hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus on <a href="#swim">Swim</a> checks.</p>
<p>At 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional form for his shifter's blessing and may use this ability one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a ranger with shifter's blessing in one of his shifted forms can be affected by a polymorph ability and retain his bonus and traits gained by the class feature. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Form Shifter (Ex)</strong>: At 12th level, when the shapeshifter takes on a shifter's blessing form, he can take on a hybrid of two of his forms. He gains the bonuses for both forms. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
<p><strong>Master Shifter (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, the ranger's shifter's blessing forms improve, and he can take on true forms of beasts. The ranger can use dual form shifter with this ability, although he cannot use more than one polymorph effect at any one time. This ability replaces master hunter. The ranger's forms from shifter's blessing improve to the following:</p>
<p><em>Form of the Bear</em>: The ranger's muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength and he does not suffer any reduction of speed. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a bear as if the caster of <em><a href="#beast-shape-iv">beast shape IV</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Cat</em>: The ranger's muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 20 feet and he gains a +10 bonus on <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="#climb">Climb</a> checks. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a cat of any size as if the caster of <em><a href="#beast-shape-iv">beast shape IV</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Dragon</em>: The ranger's skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC and a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Alternately, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a dragon as if the caster of <em><a href="#form-of-the-dragon-i">form of the dragon I</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Eagle</em>: The ranger's skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks and a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an eagle or similar raptor as if the caster of <em><a href="#beast-shape-iv">beast shape IV</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Jackal</em>: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to movement. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a jackal or other canine creature as if the caster of <em><a href="#beast-shape-iv">beast shape IV</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Form of the Otter</em>: The ranger's hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 60 feet and a +5 bonus on <a href="#swim">Swim</a> checks. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an otter or similar river mammal as if the caster of <em><a href="#beast-shape-iv">beast shape IV</a></em>.</p>
<h1 id="skirmisher">Skirmisher</h1>
<p>Many rangers rely on spells, but there are some who eschew aid from divine powers for their own reasons. Skirmishers rely on their wits, their wisdom, and sometimes even instinct to aid in their quests. A skirmisher has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Hunter's Tricks</strong>: At 5th level, a skirmisher ranger learns the use of hunter's tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the ranger or a nearby ally. At 5th level, the ranger learns one trick, selected from the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns another trick. A ranger can use these tricks a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can't be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than once. This ability replaces the ranger's spells class feature. Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.</p>
<p>The following is a list of hunter tricks and their effects.</p>
<p><em>Aiding Attack (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he hits a creature with an attack. The next ally who makes an attack against the target creature before the start of the ranger's next turn gains a +2 circumstance bonus on that attack roll.</p>
<p><em>Bolster Companion (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when his animal companion is hit with an attack or a combat maneuver. The companion's AC and combat maneuver defense increase by +4 for the purposes of that attack. If the attack still hits, the animal companion only takes half damage (if any). The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to benefit from this trick.</p>
<p><em>Catfall (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when he falls 20 or more feet, ignoring the first 20 feet of the fall when calculating the falling damage. If the ranger takes no damage from the fall, he does not fall prone.</p>
<p><em>Chameleon Step (Ex)</em>: The ranger can move up to twice his speed as a move action. The ranger does not take any penalty on <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> checks for movement during this move. This move provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
<p><em>Cunning Pantomime (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, the ranger can communicate with a single creature as if using the <em><a href="#tongues">tongues</a></em> spell for 10 minutes. Because the communication is slow and lacks subtlety, the ranger suffers a –4 penalty on all <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks relating to the creature he is communicating with when using this trick.</p>
<p><em>Defensive Bow Stance (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a swift action. Until the start of his next turn, his ranged attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Deft Stand (Ex)</em>: The ranger can spend a move action to stand up without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Distracting Attack (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a free action before he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>Hateful Attack (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he makes an attack against one of his favored enemies. The ranger doubles the threat range of his weapon for this attack. This does not stack with other abilities that increase a weapon's threat range.</p>
<p><em>Heel (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when his animal companion moves. When the companion moves, the square it starts out in is not considered threatened by any opponent it can see, and therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against it when it moves from that square. The companion must end this movement in a square adjacent to the ranger. The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to take this movement.</p>
<p><em>Hobbling Attack (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he hits with an attack. The target of the attack's land speed is reduced by 1/2 for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><em>Quick <a href="#climb">Climb</a> (Ex)</em>: The ranger can climb at his full speed as a move action without penalty.</p>
<p><em>Quick Healing (Ex)</em>: As a swift action, the ranger can make a <a href="#heal">Heal</a> check to administer first aid on an adjacent dying character. Alternatively, the ranger can administer a potion to an unconscious character as a move action.</p>
<p><em>Quick <a href="#swim">Swim</a> (Ex)</em>: The ranger can swim at his full speed as a move action without penalty.</p>
<p><em>Ranger's Counsel (Ex)</em>: As a swift action, the ranger can grant all allies within 30 feet that are within line of sight and can hear him a +2 bonus on skill checks with a single skill of his choice. The ranger must have at least one rank in the chosen skill. This bonus lasts for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>Rattling Strike (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a free action before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><em><a href="#second-chance-(combat)">Second Chance</a> Strike (Ex)</em>: When he misses with a melee attack, the ranger may reroll his attack at a –5 penalty. Using this ability is an immediate action.</p>
<p><em>Sic 'Em (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a swift action. His animal companion makes one melee attack against an adjacent creature. The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to make this attack.</p>
<p><em>Skill Sage (Ex)</em>: As a free action, the ranger can roll twice on any one skill check and take the better result. He must have at least 1 rank in that skill to use this ability.</p>
<p><em>Stag's Leap (Ex)</em>: As a free action, the ranger can attempt a running jump without moving 10 feet before the jump.</p>
<p><em>Surprise Shift (Ex)</em>: The ranger can move 5 feet as a swift action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.</p>
<p><em>Tangling Attack (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this attack as a free action when he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target is entangled for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>Trick Shot (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, the ranger can make a ranged attack that ignores concealment (but not total concealment), soft cover, and partial cover.</p>
<p><em>Uncanny Senses (Ex)</em>: As an immediate action, the ranger gains a +10 insight bonus on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>Upending Strike (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as a free action just before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, he may make a free trip combat maneuver against the target.</p>
<p><em>Vengeance Strike (Ex)</em>: The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when an enemy adjacent to him hits an ally with a melee or ranged attack. The ranger can make a single melee attack at his highest base attack bonus against the creature who attacked his ally.</p>
<h1 id="spirit-ranger">Spirit Ranger</h1>
<p>Some rangers nurture a connection with the spirits that reside in all things. By communing with these spirits, the spirit ranger can gain glimpses of things to come. A spirit ranger has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, instead of forming a bond with his hunting companions or an animal companion, the spirit ranger forms a bond with the spirits of nature themselves. Each day, as long as he is within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast <em><a href="#augury">augury</a></em> as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his ranger level. In addition, he can call upon these spirits to cast any one ranger spell that he is capable of casting, without having to prepare the spell. At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, he can cast an additional spell in this way. This replaces hunter's bond.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom of the Spirits (Sp)</strong>: At 12th level, the spirit ranger can use his <em><a href="#augury">augury</a></em> spell-like ability even when he is not in one of his favored terrains. If he is within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast <em><a href="#divination">divination</a></em> instead. Like <em><a href="#augury">augury</a></em>, the caster level of the <em><a href="#divination">divination</a></em> is equal to the ranger's level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
<h1 id="urban-ranger">Urban Ranger</h1>
<p>For the urban ranger, the streets and sewers of the city are just as dangerous as the barren wastelands or the deep forests. An urban ranger has the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Urban Ranger</strong>: At 1st level, an urban ranger adds <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) to his list of class skills and removes <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) from his list of class skills.</p>
<p><strong>Favored Community (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the urban ranger forms a bond with a community. While inside the limits of this community, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local), <a href="#perception">Perception</a>, <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a>, and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> skill checks. An urban ranger traveling through his favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although he may leave a trail if he so desires).</p>
<p>At 8th level, and every five levels thereafter, an urban ranger may select an additional favored community. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this ability, a community is any settlement consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than this minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are not considered part of a community. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Trapfinding (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an urban ranger can find and disable traps, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability replaces endurance.</p>
<p><strong>Push Through (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, an urban ranger is never slowed by difficult terrain in his favored communities. In addition, he can move through the space occupied by local citizens as if they were allies. This does not apply to creatures intent on harming the ranger. Areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him. This replaces woodland stride.</p>
<p><strong>Blend In (Ex)</strong>: An urban ranger of 12th level or higher can use his <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> bonus in place of a <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> skill check in any of his favored communities. This disguise does not take an action to don. He must make a check whenever someone attempts to pick him out from the local citizens. If his check is successful, he blends into the crowd. While not invisible, enemies do not notice his presence and take no actions against him unless they are taking actions against the local citizens in general. This replaces camouflage.</p>
<p><strong>Invisibility Trick (Sp)</strong>: At 17th level, the urban ranger can cast <em><a href="#invisibility-greater">greater invisibility</a></em> on himself as a wizard of his ranger level as a swift action. He can use this spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
<p>Rogue</p>
<h1 id="rogue">Rogue</h1>
<p>By their nature, rogues are varied and versatile. There are rogues who haunt the city, those who stalk the forest, and those who serve as agents of law. Wherever there is space for someone to make her mark with agility and wit, the rogue is there, using her wide range of skills and abilities to make a place for herself, whether openly or through cunning and subterfuge. And where a rogue's natural cunning and quick thinking aren't enough to win the day, well—there's always the option of a knife in the back.</p>
<p>The following rogue themes represent some of the most popular and effective roguish archetypes. Each archetype comes with one or more class features that must be taken. In addition, each archetype includes a number of new rogue talent suggestions that, while not mandatory, help to flesh out the character. Rogue talents and advanced rogue talents marked with an asterisk (*) in the archetype sections can be found in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following new rogue talents can be taken by any rogue who meets the prerequisites. Note that rogue talents marked with a double asterisk (**) in this list add effects to a rogue's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
<p><em>Assault Leader (Ex)</em>: Once per day, when the rogue misses with an attack on a flanked opponent, she can designate a single ally who is also flanking the target that her attack missed. That ally can make a single melee attack against the opponent as an immediate action.</p>
<p><em>Befuddling Strike** (Ex)</em>: When the rogue deals sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls against the rogue for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><em>Camouflage (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The rogue needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good for the rest of the day or until the rogue fails a saving throw against an area effect spell that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever comes first. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.</p>
<p><em>Canny Observer (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent makes a <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check to hear the details of a conversation or to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps), she gains a +4 bonus.</p>
<p><em>Charmer (Ex)</em>: Once per day, the rogue can roll two dice while making a <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check, and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Coax Information (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can use <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> in place of <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> to force an opponent to act friendly toward her.</p>
<p><em>Combat Swipe</em>: A rogue who selects this talent gains <a href="#improved-steal-(combat)">Improved Steal</a> as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><em>Cunning Trigger (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can use a swift action to set off any trap within 30 feet that she constructed.</p>
<p><em>Distracting Attack** (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can make sneak attacks with subtle flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy. When she hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to become flat-footed against one target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The rogue cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack.</p>
<p><em>Expert Leaper (Ex)</em>: When making jump checks, the rogue is always considered to have a running start. Also, when the rogue deliberately falls, a DC 15 <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen, instead of the first 10 feet.</p>
<p><em>Fast Fingers (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can roll two dice while making a <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Fast Getaway (Ex)</em>: After successfully making a sneak attack or <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check, a rogue with this talent can spend a move action to take the withdraw action. She can move no more than her speed during this movement.</p>
<p><em>Fast Picks (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can use the <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> skill to attempt to open a lock as a standard action instead of a full-round action.</p>
<p><em>Follow Clues (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can use <a href="#perception">Perception</a> to follow tracks as per the <a href="#survival">Survival</a> skill.</p>
<p><em>Guileful Polyglot (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent who has at least one rank in <a href="#linguistics">Linguistics</a> gains four additional languages. A rogue with this talent who does not have any ranks in <a href="#linguistics">Linguistics</a> gains two additional languages. If the rogue later gains ranks in <a href="#linguistics">Linguistics</a>, she gains two additional languages, to a total of four additional languages above those granted by the <a href="#linguistics">Linguistics</a> skill itself.</p>
<p><em>Hard to Fool (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can roll two dice while making a <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check, and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Honeyed Words (Ex)</em>: Once per day, the rogue can roll two dice while making a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> check, and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the Bluff check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every five rogue levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Lasting Poison (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way that it is effective for two successful attacks instead of one. The poison has a reduced effect, however, and saves made against the poison receive a +2 circumstance bonus. Applying poison in this way requires a full-round action, or a standard action if the rogue has the swift poison talent.</p>
<p><em>Nimble Climber (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent fails a <a href="#climb">Climb</a> check by 5 or more, she can immediately make another <a href="#climb">Climb</a> check at the surface's base DC +10. If successful, she stops her fall by clinging onto the surface. The rogue does not take falling damage when she stops her fall in this manner.</p>
<p><em>Offensive Defense** (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled for 1 round.</p>
<p><em>Peerless Maneuver (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can roll two dice while making an <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check, and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses.</p>
<p><em>Positioning Attack (Ex)</em>: Once per day, when a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack, she can move up to 30 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. The movement must end in a space adjacent to the creature hit with the melee attack.</p>
<p><em>Powerful Sneak** (Ex)</em>: Whenever a rogue with this talent takes a full attack action, she can elect to take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. If an attack during this time is a sneak attack, she treats all 1s on the sneak attack damage dice as 2s.</p>
<p><em>Quick Disguise (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can use the items at hand and seemingly innocuous material hidden on her person to create startlingly effective disguises, reducing the amount of time it takes to create a disguise using the <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> skill.</p>
<p>The time needed for the rogue to alter her appearance in this manner is based on the complexity of the disguise, as noted on the following table. The times are cumulative, so if a female rogue wants to disguise herself as a male of a different race, that takes 2 minutes.</p>

<p><em>Quick Trapsmith (Ex)</em>: As a full-round action, a rogue with this talent can set a simple trap with a CR no greater than 1/2 her rogue level. To do this, she must purchase the components, spend the required time constructing the trap in advance, and have its components at hand. The type of trap that can be constructed in this way is subject to GM discretion.</p>
<p><em>Snap Shot (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent may treat her intitiative roll as a 20 for a surprise round, regardless of her initiative, but she may only take an attack action with a ranged weapon. Her normal initiative roll is used in subsequent rounds. If two or more rogues possess this talent, their initiative determines the order in which they act, but they all go before any other creature. If a rogue is prevented from acting in the surprise round, this talent has no effect.</p>
<p><em>Sniper's Eye (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can apply her sneak attack damage on ranged attacks targeting foes within 30 feet that benefit from concealment. Foes with total concealment are still immune.</p>
<p><em>Strong Impression</em>: A rogue who selects this talent gains <a href="#intimidating-prowess">Intimidating Prowess</a> as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><em>Survivalist</em>: A rogue with this talent adds <a href="#heal">Heal</a> and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> to her list of class skills.</p>
<p><em>Swift Poison (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon as a move action, instead of a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Rogue Talents</strong>: The following new advanced rogue talents can be selected by any rogue of 10th level or higher who meets the prerequisites.</p>
<p><em>Another Day (Ex)</em>: Once per day, when the rogue would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a melee attack, she can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. If the movement takes her out of the reach of the attack, she takes no damage from the attack. The rogue is staggered for 1 round on her next turn.</p>
<p><em>Deadly Cocktail (Ex)</em>: A rogue with this talent can apply two doses of poison to a weapon at once. These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the poisons' frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This talent is an exception to the rule that injury poisons can only be delivered one dose at a time.</p>
<p><em>Deadly Sneak** (Ex)</em>: Whenever a rogue with this talent uses the powerful sneak rogue talent, she treats all 1s and 2s on the sneak attack damage dice as 3s. A rogue must have the powerful sneak rogue talent before choosing this talent.</p>
<p><em>Entanglement of Blades** (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the target cannot take a 5-foot step until the beginning of the rogue's next turn.</p>
<p><em>Fast Tumble (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent uses <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> to move at full speed through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity, the DC of the <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check does not increase by 10.</p>
<p><em>Frugal Trapsmith (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent constructs a mechanical trap, she only pays 75% of the normal cost.</p>
<p><em>Hunter's Surprise (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can designate a single enemy she is adjacent to as her prey. Until the end of her next turn, she can add her sneak attack damage to all attacks made against her prey, even if she is not flanking it or it is not flat-footed.</p>
<p><em>Knock-Out Blow (Ex)</em>: Once per day, the rogue can forgo her sneak attack damage to attempt to knock out an opponent. She must declare the use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage, but instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and instead of any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this effect to staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Master of Disguise (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent gains a +10 bonus on a single <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> check.</p>
<p><em>Redirect Attack (Ex)</em>: Once per day, when a rogue with this talent is hit with a melee attack, she can redirect the attack to strike at an adjacent creature with a free action. The creature targeted must be within melee reach of the attack that hit the rogue, and the creature that made the attack against the rogue must make a new attack roll against the new target.</p>
<p><em>Stealthy Sniper (Ex)</em>: When a rogue with this talent uses the <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> skill to snipe, she only suffers a –10 penalty on the <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> check, instead of –20.</p>
<p><em>Thoughtful Reexamining (Ex)</em>: Once per day, a rogue with this talent can reroll a <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a>, <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, or <a href="#perception">Perception</a> skill check to try to gain new or better information from the roll. This reroll can be made any time during the same day as the original check.</p>
<h1 id="acrobat">Acrobat</h1>
<p>Agility and daring are both excellent rogue traits, and their confluence can create spectacular feats of acrobatics. Whether they are daring thieves, infiltrating assassins, or intrepid spies, proper training in acrobatics is a valuable boon for rogues.</p>
<p><strong>Expert Acrobat (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, an acrobat does not suffer any armor check penalties on <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="#climb">Climb</a>, <a href="#fly">Fly</a>, <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a>, or <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> skill checks while wearing light armor. When she is not wearing armor, she gains a +2 competency bonus on <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Second Chance (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an acrobat can reroll any <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="#climb">Climb</a>, or <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill check she has just made. This reroll is made at a –5 penalty. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. An acrobat can use this ability only once on any given skill check. She can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the acrobat archetype: expert leaper, ledge walker*, nimble climber, peerless maneuver, rogue crawl*, and stand up*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the acrobat archetype: defensive roll*, fast getaway, fast tumble, and improved evasion*.</p>
<h1 id="burglar">Burglar</h1>
<p>Adept at infiltration, trap removal, and lock picking, burglars prey on the homes of the wealthy and forgotten tombs alike. Such riches are guarded with vicious traps and hazards, but the devious mind of the burglar allows her to find such dangers and avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>Careful Disarm (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a burglar attempts to disarm a trap using <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a>, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Distraction (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever a burglar is detected while using <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a>, she can immediately attempt a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> skill check opposed by the <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> skill of the creature that spotted her. If this check succeeds, the target assumes that the noise was something innocent and disregards the detection. This only functions if the creature cannot see the rogue. This ability can only be used once during a given <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> attempt. If the same creature detects the rogue's presence again, the ability has no effect. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the burglar archetype: fast picks, fast stealth*, nimble climber, quick disable*, and trap spotter*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the burglar archetype: knock-out blow, skill mastery*, and thoughtful reexamining.</p>
<h1 id="cutpurse">Cutpurse</h1>
<p>Everyone who lives in the city understands that a wealthy man stays wealthy by guarding his purse while wandering the streets and markets. Cutpurses are often trained by guilds to collect the guild's tax from local businesses on a daily basis, whether through intimidation or pickpocketing. Some find themselves taking up the mantle of adventurer, and their talents are generally appreciated in this role, but the cutpurse is still the first person her companions look to when an item goes missing.</p>
<p><strong>Measure the Mark (Ex)</strong>: When a cutpurse makes a <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check to take something from a creature, the target makes its <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check before the rogue makes her <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check, and the rogue knows the <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check result. She can decide whether or not to make the check based on the results of the target's <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check. If the rogue elects not to make the check, she can make a <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> check, opposed by the target's <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, to prevent the target from noticing the attempt. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Stab and Grab (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a cutpurse can make an attack and also make a <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check to steal something from the target of the attack. If the attack deals sneak attack damage, the rogue can use <a href="#sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> to take an item from the creature during combat; otherwise this ability can only be used in a surprise round before the target has acted. If the attack is successful, the target takes a –5 penalty on the <a href="#perception">Perception</a> check to notice the theft. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the cutpurse archetype: combat swipe, fast fingers, fast getaway, hard to fool, minor magic*, slow reactions*, and surprise attack*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the cutpurse archetype: crippling strike*, fast tumble, and skill mastery*.</p>
<h1 id="investigator">Investigator</h1>
<p>Not all rogues work against the law. Investigators use their skills to serve the law, often in the employ of nobles or in the pursuit of noble causes. In some cities cabals of investigators work for rulers or bureaucracies, but often an investigator is a free agent who pursues whatever mysteries come across her path. Of course, not all investigators serve the law. Crime lords and guildmasters often have squads of investigators serving their own nefarious purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Follow Up (Ex)</strong>: An investigator can roll twice on any <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check made to gather information, and receives the information for both results. This takes the same amount of time as one check. If the lesser of the two checks reveals false information, the rogue is aware of it. False information is not revealed in this way if the people she questioned do not know it to be false. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the investigator archetype: coax information, fast picks, follow clues, hard to fool, and minor magic*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the investigator archetype: hunter's surprise, slippery mind*, and thought reexamining.</p>
<h1 id="poisoner">Poisoner</h1>
<p>Some consider poisoning an evil act. The poisoner knows poison is just a tool toward an end, and is no different than any other weapon. Some poisoners see themselves as great equalizers, as they are able to craft weapons that the weakest of creatures can wield to devastating effect, but most have no lofty delusions about their work.</p>
<p><strong>Poison Use (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a poisoner is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a blade. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Master Poisoner (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a poisoner can use <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) to change the type of a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist's lab and a <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) skill check with a DC equal to the poison's DC. If successful, the poison's type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check fails, the poison is ruined. The poisoner also receives a bonus on <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) skill checks when working with poison equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the poisoner archetype: distracting attack, lasting poison, surprise attack*, swift poison, and weapon training*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the poisoner archetype: deadly cocktail, hunter's surprise, and opportunist*.</p>
<h1 id="rake">Rake</h1>
<p>The rake is a rogue who is open about her skills and talents, often to the point of being boastful. Usually she has the protection of an important figure who finds her services useful, but sometimes her bravado is enough to keep enemies away. She is often used as a face for the group for diplomacy, gathering information, negotiations, or to gain the most lucrative contracts and quests from local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Bravado's Blade (Ex)</strong>: When a rake hits an opponent and deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo 1d6 points of that damage and make a free <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> check to demoralize the foe. For every additional 1d6 points of sneak attack damage she forgoes, she receives a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Rake's Smile (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a rake gains a +1 morale bonus on <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the rake archetype: befuddling strike, charmer, honeyed words, and surprise attack*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the rake archetype: another day, redirect attack, and skill mastery*.</p>
<h1 id="scout">Scout</h1>
<p>Not all rogues live in the city. Scouts frequently roam the wilderness, often banding together as bandits, but sometimes serving as guides, as trailblazers, or as companions to a ranger or barbarian warrior. More comfortable with sneaking and hiding outdoors, the scout is still effective in the city and the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong>Scout's Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a scout makes a charge, her attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target were flat-footed. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Skirmisher (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever a scout moves more than 10 feet in a round and makes an attack action, the attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target was flat-footed. If the scout makes more than one attack this turn, this ability only applies to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the scout archetype: assault leader, camouflage, cunning trigger, survivalist, and trap spotter*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the scout archetype: hunter's surprise, skill mastery*, and stealthy sniper.</p>
<h1 id="sniper">Sniper</h1>
<p>Some say that the sniper is the worst kind of assassin: a killer who waits silently in the shadows and then strikes from a distance without remorse. Snipers, of course, understand that such protestations about “cowardice” and “honor” regarding their profession are in fact merely the bleatings of sheep fearing the slaughter and pay them no heed. Most snipers take pride in their formidable abilities, which allow them to take life quickly, quietly, and efficiently, then disappear into their surroundings without a trace.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a sniper halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow or crossbow. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Range (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a sniper increases the range at which she can apply her sneak attack damage by 10 feet. This range increases by 10 feet for every 3 levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the sniper archetype: camouflage, snap shot, sniper's eye, and weapon training*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the sniper archetype: defensive roll*, master of disguise, and stealthy sniper.</p>
<h1 id="spy">Spy</h1>
<p>The best spies are like chameleons, but not only can they change their appearances to fit the situation, they can also change their personalities, allegiances, and even loves if that's what it takes to achieve their clandestine goals. Spies are the ultimate manipulators, and even those who commission their services sometimes find that they've merely served the spies' own interests.</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Liar (Ex)</strong>: Whenever a spy uses <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> to attempt to deceive someone, she gains a bonus on the opposed roll equal to 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1). This bonus does not apply to feint attempts or attempts to pass secret messages. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Poison Use (Ex)</strong>: A 3rd level, a spy is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a blade. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the spy archetype: canny observer, guileful polyglot, honeyed words, major magic*, minor magic*, and quick disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the spy archetype: crippling strike*, master of disguise, and stealthy sniper.</p>
<h1 id="swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</h1>
<p>A paragon of mobile swordplay, the swashbuckler is a rogue who focuses almost exclusively on honing her skill at arms and perfecting daring acrobatic moves and elaborate flourishes that border on performance.</p>
<p><strong>Martial Training (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, the swashbuckler may select one martial weapon to add to her list of weapon proficiencies. In addition, she may take the combat trick rogue talent up to two times. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Daring (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a swashbuckler gains a +1 morale bonus on <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks and saving throws against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the swashbuckler archetype: offensive defense, positioning attack, powerful sneak, and weapon training*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the swashbuckler archetype: crippling strike*, entanglement of blades, and redirect attack.</p>
<h1 id="thug">Thug</h1>
<p>Some criminals steal with finesse, their victims only discovering the crime when the rogue is long gone and the coin already spent. A thug, on the other hand, cares nothing for finesse. Through both threat and violence, the thug gets what she wants by the promise of force, and has no problem making good on that promise as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Frightening (Ex)</strong>: Whenever a thug successfully uses <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> to demoralize a creature, the duration of the shaken condition is increased by 1 round. In addition, if the target is shaken for 4 or more rounds, the thug can instead decide to make the target frightened for 1 round. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
<p><strong>Brutal Beating (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, whenever a thug deals sneak attack damage, she can choose to forgo 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to make the target sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability does not stack with itself—only the most recent duration applies. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the thug archetype: offensive defense, powerful sneak, strong impression, and weapon training*.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the thug archetype: crippling strike*, deadly sneak, and knock-out blow.</p>
<h1 id="trapsmith">Trapsmith</h1>
<p>Some rogues are not content with just disabling traps—they love to build them, finding a captivating beauty in the turning of gears and the slither of ropes over pulleys. The trapsmith may have started out putting together traps in order to better understand how to disable them, but for most, it's long since gone beyond that—they now relish the challenge of creating the perfect combat machine.</p>
<p><strong>Careful Disarm (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a trapsmith attempts to disarm a trap using <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a>, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Trap Master (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap using <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a>, she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting enemies if she desires. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue Talents</strong>: The following rogue talents complement the trapsmith archetype: befuddling strike, cunning trigger, quick disable*, and quick trapsmith.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Talents</strong>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the trapsmith archetype: another day, frugal trapsmith, and skill mastery*.</p>
<p>Sorcerer</p>
<h1 id="sorcerer">Sorcerer</h1>
<p>Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing—or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves. Presented below are a number of new bloodlines representing the mysterious origin of your sorcerer's abilities.</p>
<p>New spells presented in Chapter 5 are marked here with asterisks (*).</p>
<h1 id="aquatic">Aquatic</h1>
<p>Your family traces its heritage back to the ocean depths, whether scions of undersea empires left in the wake of nomadic sea-tribes, or the spawn of creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages.

<p><em>Spatial Tear (Sp)</em>: At 15th level, once per day, you can unravel the fibers of reality and ride along them as they snap back into place.

<p><strong>Bloodline Powers</strong>: Your skyward gaze and communion with the heavens focus and enhance your magical talents.</p>
<p><em>Minute Meteors (Sp)</em>: At 1st level, you can summon a rain of tiny meteorites as a standard action to fall in a 5-foot column, 30 feet high, with a range of 30 feet. The meteors inflict 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 per 2 sorcerer levels. A Reflex save negates this damage. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier.

<p><em>Aurora Borealis (Sp)</em>: At 9th level, you can create a sheet of cascading colors. This power acts as a <em><a href="#wall-of-fire">wall of fire</a></em>, but it inflicts cold damage and does not radiate heat. However, one side of the aurora designated by you fascinates creatures within 10 feet, up to a maximum of 2 HD of creatures per sorcerer level. A Will save negates this fascinate effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. You may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p><em>Breaching the Gulf (Sp)</em>: At 15th level, your caster level is increased by 3 when casting spells of the teleportation subschool. In addition, once per day you can teleport a single creature within 30 feet into the void of space if it fails a Will save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. The target can attempt a new saving throw as a full-round action each round to return.

<p><em>Starborn (Ex)</em>: At 20th level, you gain immunity to cold and blindness, and you can see perfectly in natural or magical darkness. In addition, you gain fast healing 1 when you are outdoors at night.</p>

<p><strong>Bloodline Arcana</strong>: Whenever you cast a spell with the electricity or sonic descriptor, increase the save DC by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodline Powers</strong>: Your mastery of the storm is reflected in the unique panoply of powers you manifest.</p>
<p><em>Thunderstaff (Sp)</em>: At 1st level, you can touch a weapon as a standard action, giving it the <em><a href="#weapons-shock">shock</a></em> property for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). At 9th level, you can confer the <em><a href="#weapons-shocking-burst">shocking burst</a></em> property instead, but the duration of the power is halved. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Stormchild (Ex)</em>: At 3rd level, you gain resist electricity 5 and resist sonic 5, and treat wind effects as being one step less severe.

<p><em>Thunderbolt (Sp)</em>: At 9th level, you can command a stroke of lightning to strike from above in a 5-foot-radius cylinder 60 feet high. The thunderbolt inflicts 1d6 points of damage per sorcerer level; half of this damage is electricity and half is sonic. A Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) halves this damage. Creatures failing their saves are deafened for 1 round. At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day, at 17th twice per day, and at 20th three times per day. This power has a range of 120 feet.</p>
<p><em><a href="#ride">Ride</a> the Lightning (Sp)</em>: At 15th level, as a full-round action you can become a living lightning bolt and move in a straight line up to 10 times your speed. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity while moving in this way. Creatures or objects in your path are affected as by your thunderbolt power. Creatures do not block your movement but solid barriers do unless they are reduced to 0 hit points. You can use this power once per day for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level.</p>
<p><em>Storm Lord (Ex)</em>: At 20th level, you are one with the storm. You gain immunity to deafness, stunning, and wind effects and gain blindsight 120 feet against concealment from natural or magical fog, mist, or weather. Once per day, when attacked with an electricity or sonic effect, you may forgo your saving throw and absorb the energies of the attack, healing 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise have dealt.</p>
<h1 id="verdant">Verdant</h1>

<p><strong>Bloodline Arcana</strong>: Whenever you cast a spell with a range of personal, your skin toughens, granting you a natural armor bonus equal to the spell's level for 1d4 rounds. This bonus does not stack with any other natural armor bonuses you might have.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodline Powers</strong>: The power of living things infuses every aspect of your magic, as you draw power from nature and its life energies flow through you.</p>
<p><em>Tanglevine (Sp)</em>: At 1st level, as a standard action, you can create a 15-foot-long, animated vine that springs from your hand. This vine lasts for 1 round and can be used to make a single disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuver, using your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier in place of your normal CMB. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><em>Photosynthesis (Ex)</em>: At 3rd level, you feed upon nature's raw essence. Your need to eat and sleep is reduced as if wearing a <em><a href="#ring-of-sustenance">ring of sustenance</a></em>, and you gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws made against poison and sleep effects. At 9th level, these bonuses increase to +4.</p>
<p><em>Massmorph (Sp)</em>: At 9th level, as a full-round action, you can alter the size and health of plant life, as if using <em><a href="#plant-growth">plant growth</a></em>or <em><a href="#diminish-plants">diminish plants</a></em>. Alternatively, you can transform one willing non-plant creature per sorcerer level (no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart) as <em><a href="#tree-shape">tree shape</a></em>. You may transform creatures as <em><a href="#plant-shape-i">plant shape I</a></em>at 15th level, or <em><a href="#plant-shape-ii">plant shape II</a></em> at 20th level. You can transform non-plant creatures using this power once per day.</p>
<p><em>Rooting (Ex)</em>: At 15th level, as a move action, you can extend roots into the ground.

You also gain tremorsense 30 feet and fast healing 1. You can use this power for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
<p><em>Shepherd of the Trees (Su)</em>: At 20th level, your verdant heritage fully manifests. You gain a +4 natural armor bonus. You gain immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning, and you gain tremorsense 30 feet even when not rooted.</p>
<p>Wizard</p>
<h1 id="wizard">Wizard</h1>
<p>Bending reality to their will through careful study, wizards are the embodiment of the phrase “mind over matter,” changing whole worlds with nothing but their keen intellects and ancient lore. In their quest to unravel and repurpose the fundamental laws of existence, many wizards come to appreciate the benefits of narrowly focusing their study. Presented below are several new schools of magic to help you customize your wizard's arcane pursuits.</p>
<h1 id="elemental-arcane-schools">Elemental Arcane Schools</h1>
<p>Instead of specializing in one of the standard eight schools of magic, a wizard can choose to specialize in one of the four elemental schools of magic. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school's spell list (see Chapter 5). Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.</p>
<h2 id="air-school">Air School</h2>
<p>The air elementalist uses the forces of the wind, sky, clouds, and lightning to confuse and destroy his foes, all while flying through the air with ease.</p>
<p><em>Air Supremacy (Su)</em>: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast <em><a href="#feather-fall">feather fall</a></em> on yourself at will. At 5th level, you can cast <em><a href="#levitate">levitate</a></em> on yourself at will. At 10th level, you can cast <em><a href="../../spells/fly.html">fly</a></em>on yourself at will. At 20th level, whenever you make a <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.</p>
<p><em>Lightning Flash (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the dazzled effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Cyclone (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind around yourself as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to 10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess. Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any flying creature moving through the vortex must make a <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill check or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the creature cannot make a <a href="#fly">Fly</a> check to reduce or negate this damage). Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without first making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your caster level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15 <a href="#perception">Perception</a> skill check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="earth-school">Earth School</h2>
<p>The earth elementalist draws power from the stone around him, shaping it, shattering it, and bending it to his will. He can use it to defend himself or cause it to rise up and crush his foes.</p>
<p><em>Earth Supremacy (Su)</em>: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your CMD to resist bull rush, reposition, trip, and overrun attempts as long as you are touching the ground. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you gain a +1 insight bonus on melee attack and damage rolls whenever both you and your foe are touching the ground. At 20th level, earth and stone do not block the line of effect of your spells, although they do still block your line of sight.</p>
<p><em>Acid Cloud (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius cloud of acid vapor within 30 feet that lasts for 1 round. This cloud deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures in the cloud and sickens them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that begin their turn inside the cloud can move out that turn without penalty, but those that enter the cloud are affected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Earth Glide (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you gain the ability to move through earth, dirt, and stone for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. You cannot move through worked earth or stone; only natural substances can be traversed. If your total duration expires before you exit the earth, you are flung back to the point where you entered the stone, take 4d6 points of damage, and are stunned for 1 round. Your burrowing does not leave a hole, nor does it give any sign of your presence (although you can be detected by creatures with tremorsense). These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="fire-school">Fire School</h2>
<p>The fire elementalist sees a world around him that is made to burn, and he can bring that fire to consume his foes. He has also learned that fire can purify and protect, if properly controlled.</p>
<p><em>Fire Supremacy (Su)</em>: You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of flame at least as large as a campfire, you can draw the fire around you for 1 round as a swift action. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or unarmed strike takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with reach avoid this damage.</p>
<p><em>Fire Jet (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of fire. Anyone in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their saving throw catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage on the following round. Creatures that catch fire can avoid this damage by taking a full-round action to extinguish the flames by making a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground gives a +2 circumstance bonus on the save. Dousing the creature with water automatically extinguishes the flame. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Dancing Flame (Su)</em>: At 8th level, as a standard action, you can sculpt fire to suit your desires. With one use of this ability you can move any nonmagical fire up to 30 feet. Alternatively you can use this ability to alter any fire spell that you cast with a duration of instantaneous by removing any number of squares from its area of affect. If the fire spell has a duration, you can use this ability to reposition the spell, within its original range (treat this as if you had just cast the spell, even though the duration is unchanged). You cannot use this ability on a fire spell that you did not cast. If you move a nonmagical flame, it must have a new source of fuel. If it does not, it is extinguished in one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.</p>
<h2 id="water-school">Water School</h2>
<p>The water elementalist draws magic from the ocean depths. His power is fluid as well, crushing foes in mighty waves or wearing them down through timeless erosion.</p>
<p><em>Water Supremacy (Su)</em>: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on <a href="#swim">Swim</a> skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid drowning. At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. At 20th level, whenever you make a <a href="#swim">Swim</a> skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.</p>
<p><em>Cold Blast (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of freezing cold. This blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and staggers them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the staggered effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><em>Wave (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you can create a wave of water that starts at your location and moves 30 feet per round away from you in a direction of your choosing. Creatures struck by the wave might be knocked down and pushed away. Make a caster level check against the CMD of each creature struck. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone. If your check exceeds the CMD of the creature by 5 or more, it is carried with the wave during the wave's movement this round. You receive a +5 bonus on this check if the creature shares its space with the wave at the start of your turn (when the wave moves). Creatures carried in this way can move out of the wave on their turn if they succeed on a Strength check (DC = 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier), but they cannot breathe while sharing space with the wave. The wave is up to 20 feet high and up to 5 feet long for each wizard level you possess. Nonmagical fires hit by the wave are automatically extinguished. Magical fire effects are unaffected. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.</p>
<h1 id="focused-arcane-schools">Focused Arcane Schools</h1>
<p>Wizards that specialize in one of the schools of magic can instead chose to focus their studies still further. Wizards who choose a focused arcane school retain the bonus spells from their school and must select two prohibited schools as normal, but the focused school changes one or more of the powers granted by their arcane school. A wizard must take all of the replacement powers associated with his focused arcane school. Once a focused arcane school is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
<h2 id="admixture-school">Admixture School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Evocation.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the force missile and elemental wall powers of the evocation school.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Evocation (Su)</strong>: When you cast an evocation spell that does acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you may change the damage dealt to one of the other four energy types. This changes the descriptor of the spell to match the new energy type. Any non-damaging effects remain unchanged unless the new energy type invalidates them (an <em><a href="#ice-storm">ice storm</a></em> that deals fire damage might still provide a penalty on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks due to smoke, but it would not create difficult terrain). Such effects are subject to GM discretion. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that transforms magical energy. Choose an energy type from acid, cold, electricity, and fire, and a second type to transform it into. Any magical source of energy of this type with a caster level equal to or less than your wizard level is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater than your caster level. For example, you could transform a white dragon's frigid breath weapon (a supernatural ability), but not a fire elemental's fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If an effect lies only partially within your aura, only the portions within the aura are transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="banishment-school">Banishment School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Abjuration.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the energy absorption power and the protective ward power of the abjuration school.</p>
<p><strong>Unstable Bonds (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, your touch can disrupt the bonds that hold a summoned or called creature on this plane. As a melee touch attack, you can cause a summoned or called creature to become shaken and staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Banishment (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of banishment for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Any summoned or called creature in the area must make a Will save each round. Once the creature fails a Will saving throw, it is staggered as long as it remains inside the aura. If it fails a second Will saving throw, it is immediately sent back to its home plane and the spell that summoned it immediately ends. If that spell summoned more than one creature, only the creature that failed its saving throws is affected. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="controller-school">Controller School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Enchantment.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the enchanting smile and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.</p>
<p><strong>Force of Will (Su)</strong>: You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you have charmed or dominated as though you shared a common language. At 11th level, affected creatures can communicate back to you via the telepathic link as well. At 20th level, any creature that succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment spell you have just cast is still affected for 1 round if the spell has a duration greater than 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>Irresistible Demand (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, you can force others to do your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature as though using the <em><a href="#dominate-monster">dominate monster</a></em> spell, except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control over a dominated creature.</p>
<h2 id="counterspell-school">Counterspell School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Abjuration.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the protective ward power and the energy absorption power of the abjuration school.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, you gain the ability to disrupt spellcasting with a touch. As a melee touch attack, you can place a disruptive field around the target. While the field is in place, the target must make a concentration check to cast any spell or to use a spell-like ability in addition to any other required concentration checks. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell's level. If the check is failed, the target's spell is wasted. This field lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Counterspell Mastery (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, you gain <a href="#improved-counterspell">Improved Counterspell</a> as a bonus feat. You may attempt to counterspell an opponent's spell once per day as an immediate action (instead of a readied action). You must use a spell at least one level higher than the spell being countered to use this ability. You can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th.</p>
<h2 id="creation-school">Creation School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Conjuration.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the acid dart power and the dimensional steps power of the conjuration school.</p>
<p><strong>Create Gear (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, you can create any object that weighs no more than 1 pound per wizard level you possess. Creating an object in this way is a standard action. The item remains for 1 minute before fading away, although it disappears after one round if it leaves your possession. Creating an item to an exact specification might require a <a href="#craft">Craft</a> skill check, subject to GM discretion. The object must be made of simple materials, such as wood, stone, glass, or metal, and cannot contain any moving parts. You could use this ability to create a dagger, but not a vial of alchemist's fire. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Creator's Will (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, you can cast <em><a href="#minor-creation">minor creation</a></em> as a spell-like ability. You can have no more than one <em><a href="#minor-creation">minor creation</a></em> active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the previous casting immediately ends. At 12th level, this ability improves to <em><a href="#major-creation">major creation</a></em>. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.</p>
<h2 id="enhancement-school">Enhancement School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Transmutation.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the telekinetic fist and change shape powers of the transmutation school.</p>
<p><strong>Augment (Sp)</strong>: As a standard action, you can touch a creature and grant it either a +2 enhancement bonus to a single ability score of your choice or a +1 bonus to natural armor that stacks with any natural armor the creature might possess. At 10th level, the enhancement bonus to one ability score increases to +4. The natural armor bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. This augmentation lasts a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1 round). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Perfection of Self (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, as a swift action you can grant yourself an enhancement bonus to a single ability score equal to 1/2 your wizard level (maximum +10) for one round. You may use this ability for a number of times per day equal to your wizard level.</p>
<h2 id="foresight-school">Foresight School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Divination.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the diviner's fortune and scrying adept powers of the divination school.</p>
<p><strong>Prescience (Su)</strong>: At the beginning of your turn, you may, as a free action, roll a single d20. At any point before your next turn, you may use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll you are required to make. If you do not use the d20 result before your next turn, it is lost. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Foretell (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, you can utter a prediction of the immediate future. While your foretelling is in effect, you emit a 30-foot aura of fortune that aids your allies or hinders your enemies, as chosen by you at the time of prediction. If you choose to aid, you and your allies gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you choose to hinder, your enemies take a –2 penalty on those rolls instead. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="generation-school">Generation School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Evocation.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the intense spells and force missile powers of the evocation school.</p>
<p><strong>Lingering Evocations (Su)</strong>: Any evocation spell you cast with a duration greater than instantaneous lasts an additional number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th level, any dispel checks made against your evocation spells must be rolled twice, and your opponent must use the less favorable result.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Servant (Sp)</strong>: As a standard action, you can generate a blast of air that hurls an unattended object (or objects) or an object in your possession up to 30 feet in a straight line. If you have a free hand, you can catch an object hurled toward yourself. You can move objects weighing up to 1 pound per wizard level. Objects are not thrown with enough force to cause damage, although fragile objects like alchemical weapons shatter on contact with a creature or hard surface. To hit a creature with an object, you must succeed at a ranged touch attack. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h2 id="life-school">Life School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the power over undead and grave touch powers of the necromancy school.</p>
<p><strong>Healing Grace (Su)</strong>: Whenever you cast a spell that has targets, affects creatures in an area, or requires an attack roll, you may heal creatures affected by the spell a total of 1 point of damage per level of the spell. This healing may be spread out between the targets of the spell in any way you choose. If you assign any of the healing to an undead creature, it instead takes 1 point of damage for each point assigned. At 11th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 2 points of damage per level of the spell. This healing occurs when the spell is cast and has no effect on creatures that enter its area after the spell is in place. At 20th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 3 points of damage per level of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Share Essence (Sp)</strong>: As a standard action, you can share your vital energy with a living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to or greater than your current hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received (prevented damage is not counted). These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself temporary hit points. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. This ability has no effect if you are immune to nonlethal damage.</p>
<h2 id="manipulator-school">Manipulator School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Enchantment.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the dazing touch and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.</p>
<p><strong>Beguiling Touch (Sp)</strong>: You can charm a living creature by touching it. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected, as are creatures in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward you. Creatures receive a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their save are affected by <em><a href="#charm-monster">charm monster</a></em> for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Shape Emotions (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura to either ward off or welcome emotional influence for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. If you choose to ward, you and your allies within this aura receive a +4 morale bonus on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects, and any fear effects targeting you or your allies are reduced by one step (shaken has no effect, frightened becomes shaken, and panicked becomes frightened). If you chose to enhance emotional influence, enemies within the aura receive a –2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="phantasm-school">Phantasm School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Illusion.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the blinding ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.</p>
<p><strong>Terror (Su)</strong>: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack that causes a creature to be assailed by nightmares only it can see. The creature provokes an attack of opportunity from you or an ally of your choice. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Bedeviling Aura (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that bedevils your enemies with phantasmal assailants. Enemies within this aura move at half speed, are unable to take attacks of opportunity, and are considered to be flanked. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id="scryer-school">Scryer School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Divination.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following school power replaces the diviner's fortune power of the divination school.</p>
<p><strong>Send Senses (Sp)</strong>: As a standard action, you place a scrying sensor at a point within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/wizard level) that you can see and have line of effect to. You can see or hear (not both) through this sensor for number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). The sensor otherwise functions as a <em>clairaudience/clairovoyance</em> spell with a caster level equal to your wizard level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h2 id="shadow-school">Shadow School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Illusion.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Powers</strong>: The following school powers replace the blinding ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.</p>
<p><strong>Binding Darkness (Sp)</strong>: As a standard action, you cast a weave of shadows at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The shadows entangle your foe for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every five wizard levels you possess. In conditions of bright light, this duration is halved (minimum 1 round). A creature entangled by your shadows has concealment from those without darkvision or the ability to see in darkness, and other creatures likewise have concealment relative to it. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow Step (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, you can use this ability to walk through the Shadow Plane and reappear as a standard action. You can travel up to 30 feet per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in 5-foot increments and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you arrive, you re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown <a href="#throw-splash-weapon">splash weapons</a>. If this would place you in an occupied square, you instead arrive in the nearest safe location. When you arrive, you are cloaked in shadow and gain concealment as the <em><a href="#blur">blur</a></em> spell for 1 round. You may bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you. They likewise re-enter off target (roll location for each creature) and are cloaked in shadow for 1 round.</p>
<h2 id="shapechange-school">Shapechange School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Transmutation.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following school power replaces the telekinetic fist power of the transmutation school.</p>
<p><strong>Battleshaping (Su)</strong>: As a swift action, you grow a single natural weapon. The natural weapon lasts for 1 round and has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for every four wizard levels you possess. You can grow a claw, a bite, or a gore attack. These attacks deal the normal damage for a creature of your size. At 11th level, you can shape two natural weapons. You may not grow additional limbs or a tail with this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h2 id="teleportation-school">Teleportation School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Conjuration.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following school power replaces the acid dart power of the conjuration school.</p>
<p><strong>Shift (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, you can teleport to a nearby space as a swift action as if using <em><a href="#dimension-door">dimension door</a></em>. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to see the space that you are moving into. You cannot take other creatures with you when you use this ability (except for familiars). You can move 5 feet for every two wizard levels you possess (minimum 5 feet). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h2 id="undead-school">Undead School</h2>
<p><strong>Associated School</strong>: Necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following school power replaces the grave touch power of the necromancy school.</p>
<p><strong>Bolster (Sp)</strong>: As a standard action, you can touch an undead creature and infuse it with negative energy. It gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls and saving throws, as well as 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die and a +2 bonus to its turn resistance. The bonus on attack rolls and saving throws increases by +1 for every 5 wizard levels you possess. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1 round). The bonuses and temporary hit points are immediately dispelled if the creature is within the area of a <em><a href="#consecrate">consecrate</a></em> spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>

<h1 id="battle-herald">Battle Herald</h1>
<p>In every army there are leaders who surpass the average cold-hearted mercenary, battle-scarred veteran, or wizened drill instructor, not so much in their skill at arms but in their ability to inspire and lead others. Battle heralds are just such captains—skilled warriors to be sure, but ones who have honed the art of leadership to a keen edge and keep it as ready as their sword as a means to victory. Battle heralds tap into reservoirs of courage, skill, bravery, and perseverance that those who serve with them never knew they had, and their allies often find themselves ascending the mount of triumph following the battle herald's glorious (if often tattered) banner.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-6">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the battle herald prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A battle herald gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring Command (Ex)</strong>: A battle herald uses her keen tactical acumen and decisive judgment to lead others to victory, as well as her mastery of command to assist herself and her allies in battle.</p>
<p>All battle heralds may use inspiring command to inspire courage (as the bardic performance ability); bard and battle herald levels stack to determine the bonuses provided by inspire courage.</p>
<p>At 1st level, and every two levels thereafter, the battle herald chooses one command to learn. Unless otherwise noted, these abilities provide a competence bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to her and to all allies within 60 feet able to see or hear her. Commands marked with an asterisk have the same range as above but only affect a certain number of allies (which can include the battle herald).</p>
<p>Issuing an inspiring command is a move action. At 5th level, this becomes a swift action, and at 10th level, it becomes an immediate action. Maintaining an inspiring command is a free action that cannot be disrupted, but its effects end immediately if the battle herald is killed or otherwise prevented from taking actions (such as being dazed, helpless, or stunned). The battle herald cannot have more than one command in effect at a time. She may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Charisma modifier, plus 2 additional rounds per level after 1st. She may use rounds of bardic performance to issue inspiring commands, but not vice versa. Inspiring commands are language-dependent, mind-affecting effects. The battle herald cannot maintain an inspiring command and a bardic performance at the same time (this does not preclude abilities such as persistent command or the <a href="#lingering-performance">Lingering Performance</a> feat, which continue an inspiring command or bardic performance after the battle herald stops maintaining it).</p>
<p><em>Battle Magic*</em>: One ally gains a bonus on caster level checks and concentration checks equal to the battle herald's command bonus.</p>
<p><em>Inspire Hardiness</em>: Allies gain DR/— equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus.</p>
<p><em>Inspired Tactics</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls, on combat maneuver checks, and as a dodge bonus to AC against any attacks of opportunity provoked by combat maneuvers.</p>
<p><em>Keep Your Heads</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on Will saves and concentration checks.</p>
<p><em>None Shall Fall*</em>: A number of allies equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus heal 1d6 points of damage. Targeted allies who are poisoned may attempt a new poison saving throw with a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus; a failed save has no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing the poison. This healing is not positive energy and can heal undead creatures.</p>
<p><em>Pincer Maneuver</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to attack and damage rolls when flanking and as a dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement (including standing from prone).</p>
<p><em>Rally</em>: Allies affected by a fear effect may attempt a new saving throw against each fear effect on them; this new save has a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus.</p>
<p><em>Reveille</em>: Allies affected by exhaustion, fatigue, or sleep effects may attempt a new saving throw against each such effect; this new save has a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. Allies who are sleeping normally automatically awaken when this ability is used.</p>
<p><em>Scatter*</em>: A number of allies equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus gain the benefits of the <a href="#wind-stance">Wind Stance</a> feat.</p>
<p><em>Shake It Off*</em>: One ally subject to an ongoing condition may attempt a new saving throw to negate the effects with a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. This ability does not help against instantaneous effects, effects that require recurring saving throws to avoid additional penalties (such as diseases and poisons), or effects that do not allow a saving throw.</p>
<p><em>Sound the Charge</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to attack and damage rolls. Charging allies increase their speed by 5 feet times the battle herald's inspiring command bonus.</p>
<p><em>Sound the Retreat</em>: Allies gain the benefit of the <a href="#lightning-stance">Lightning Stance</a> feat. The battle herald must have the scatter ability to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Stand Firm</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to CMD and on Fortitude saves.</p>
<p><em>Teamwork</em>: Allies add the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on skill checks or attack rolls made when using the aid another action, and if successful, the assisted ally increases the aid another bonus by an amount equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus.</p>
<p><em>Tuck and Roll</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on Reflex saves and <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Improved <a href="#leadership">Leadership</a> (Ex)</strong>: A battle herald with the <a href="#leadership">Leadership</a> feat adds her inspiring command bonus to her leadership score.</p>
<p><strong>Voice of Authority (Ex)</strong>: A battle herald is skilled at shouting commands over the din of the battlefield and signaling allies when speech is impossible. She gains a +2 bonus on <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> and <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks with creatures with which she shares a language. In addition, her allies gain a bonus equal to the battle herald's class level on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> or <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks to hear her commands or interpret her secret messages conveyed with <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a>. The battle herald's levels stack with cavalier levels for the purpose of the cavalier's tactician ability.</p>
<p><strong>Easy March (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, allies within 60 feet of the battle herald can hustle or force march during overland travel without ill effects for a number of hours per day equal to 1 hour times her inspiring command bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Greatness (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a battle herald may use her inspiring command ability to inspire greatness (as the 9th-level bardic performance ability). This ability affects one creature at 4th level, two at 7th, and three at 10th.</p>
<p><strong>Banner (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a battle herald may fly a battle standard that inspires her allies. This ability is identical to the cavalier's banner ability, and cavalier levels stack with battle herald levels to determine the bonuses provided by the banner.</p>
<p><strong>Teamwork Feat</strong>: At 6th level, a battle herald receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. She can use her cavalier tactician ability as a move action to grant this feat to allies (if she has the cavalier greater tactician ability, this is a swift action).</p>
<p><strong>Demanding Challenge (Ex)</strong>: This ability is identical to the 12th-level cavalier demanding challenge ability.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Commands (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a battle herald may allow her inspiring commands to persist even if she is incapacitated and unable to maintain them. If the player chooses, the effects of the battle herald's inspiring commands persist for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (these count toward her number of rounds per day limit). This ability does not apply if the battle herald intentionally stops maintaining an inspiring command—only if she is dazed, held, stunned, killed, and so on, and is unable to maintain them. If the battle herald recovers from incapacity while an inspiring command is ongoing, she may resume maintaining it as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire Last Stand (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a battle herald may use inspiring command to grant herself and all allies within 30 feet the benefits of the <a href="#diehard">Diehard</a> feat. Conscious affected creatures also gain the benefits of inspire courage while at negative hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Complex Commands (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a battle herald can have more than one command ability in effect at one time. Each must be begun separately and requires a separate maintenance cost. This allows the battle herald to have more than one single-target command (such as battle magic) in effect at the same time. The effects of multiple instances of the same command ability do not stack, even if the bonuses provided by that ability would normally stack (for example, if the battle herald maintains two pincer maneuver commands, her allies do not get double the bonus, even though dodge bonuses normally stack).</p>
<p>The battle herald can also maintain one bardic performance in addition to her inspiring commands, though each must be begun separately and each requires its own maintenance cost.</p>
<p>Holy Vindicator</p>
<h1 id="holy-vindicator">Holy Vindicator</h1>
<p>Many faiths have within their membership an order of the church militant, be they holy knights or dark warriors, who put their lives and immortal souls on the line for their faith. They are paragons of battle, eschewing sermons for steel. These men and women are living conduits of divine power, down to their very blood, which they happily shed in a moment if it brings greater glory to their deity or judgment upon heretics, infidels, and all enemies of the faith.</p>
<p>Holy vindicators are usually clerics or fighter/clerics, though many paladins (or even paladin/clerics) are drawn to this class as well. In all cases, the class offers a further opportunity to fuse and refine their martial and ministerial powers and role.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: The holy vindicator has substantial spellcasting ability, though not so much as a focused cleric or paladin. His combat skills are considerable and his healing powers prodigious, and those whose religious views align well with the vindicator will find a ready ally.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: While lawful vindicators are somewhat more common, vindicators may be of any alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h1>
<p>To qualify to become a holy vindicator, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Channel energy class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Feats</strong>: <a href="#alignment-channel">Alignment Channel</a> or <a href="#elemental-channel">Elemental Channel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.</p>
<h1 id="class-skills-8">Class Skills</h1>
<p>The vindicator's class skills are <a href="#climb">Climb</a> (Str), <a href="#heal">Heal</a> (Wis), <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (planes) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int), <a href="#ride">Ride</a> (Dex), <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> (Wis), <a href="#spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> (Int), and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> (Str).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks per Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-7">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the holy vindicator prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A vindicator is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and all armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a vindicator gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits of that class other than spells per day, spells known, and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a vindicator, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.</p>
<p><strong>Channel Energy (Su)</strong>: The vindicator's class level stacks with levels in any other class that grants the channel energy ability.</p>
<p><strong>Vindicator's Shield (Su)</strong>: A vindicator can channel energy into his shield as a standard action; when worn, the shield gives the vindicator a sacred bonus (if positive energy) or profane bonus (if negative energy) to his Armor Class equal to the number of dice of the vindicator's channel energy. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the vindicator is struck in combat, whichever comes first. The shield does not provide this bonus to any other wielder, but the vindicator does not need to be holding the shield for it to retain this power.</p>
<p><strong>Stigmata (Su)</strong>: A vindicator willingly gives his blood in service to his faith, and is marked by scarified wounds appropriate to his deity. He may stop or start the flow of blood by force of will as a standard action; at 6th level it becomes a move action, and at 10th level it becomes a swift action. Activating stigmata causes bleed damage equal to half the vindicator's class level, and this bleed damage is not halted by curative magic. While the stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator gains a sacred bonus (if he channels positive energy) or profane bonus (if he channels negative energy) equal to half his class level. Each time he activates his stigmata, the vindicator decides if the bonus applies to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Armor Class, caster level checks, or saving throws; to change what the bonus applies to, the vindicator must deactivate and reactivate his stigmata.</p>
<p>While his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator ignores blood drain and bleed damage from any other source and can use <em><a href="#bleed">bleed</a></em> or <em><a href="#stabilize">stabilize</a></em> at will as a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Faith Healing (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, any <em>cure wounds</em> spells a vindicator casts on himself are automatically empowered as if by the <a href="#empower-spell">Empower Spell</a> feat, except they do not use higher spell level slots or an increased casting time. If the vindicator targets himself with a cure spell that affects multiple creatures, this ability only applies to himself. At 8th level, these healing spells are maximized rather than empowered.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Wrath (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 1st-level spell or available 1st-level spell slot to invoke <em><a href="#doom">doom</a></em> upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC is increased by +2 if his weapon has a ×3 damage multiplier, or by +4 if it is ×4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodfire (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, while a vindicator's stigmata are bleeding, his blood runs down his weapons like sacred or profane liquid energy; when he uses <a href="#channel-smite">Channel Smite</a>, the damage increases by 1d6, and if the target fails its save, it is sickened and takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round on its turn. The target can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#channel-smite">Channel Smite</a></strong>: At 5th level, a vindicator gains <a href="#channel-smite">Channel Smite</a> as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Channel (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a vindicator's channel energy can instead affect a 30-foot cone or a 120-foot line.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Judgment (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, when a vindicator's melee attack reduces a creature to -1 or fewer hit points, he may sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell or available 2nd-level spell slot to invoke <em><a href="#death-knell">death knell</a></em> upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). As vindicators mete out divine judgment, this is not an evil act. The save DC increases by +2 if his weapon has a ×3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is ×4.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodrain (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, while his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator's harmful channeled energy is accompanied by a burst of sacred or profane liquid energy, increasing the damage by 1d6. Creatures failing their saves against the channeled energy become sickened and take 1d6 points of bleed damage each round. Affected creatures can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Retribution (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 3rd-level spell or available 3rd-level spell slot to invoke <em><a href="#bestow-curse">bestow curse</a></em> upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC increases by +2 if his weapon has a ×3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is ×4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.</p>
<p>Horizon Walker</p>
<h1 id="horizon-walker">Horizon Walker</h1>
<p>Those whose wanderlust drives them to push the boundary of safe environments sometimes seek the calling of the horizon walker. Horizon walkers are masters of travel, always seeking to find the safe ways through inhospitable terrain. They are comfortable in places others speak of only in hushed whispers, and they can both venture forth onto untrod paths themselves and guide the less-traveled through such hazardous lands.</p>
<p>Though rangers are most likely to be attracted to the ever-wandering life common to horizon walkers, barbarians, fighters, and rogues have also been known to find it appealing. Horizon walkers are most common in areas on the edge of civilization, where they can easily spend time away from the known and boring streets of settled lands.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Horizon walkers have the accuracy and resilience to face frontline combat. They also have the skills and abilities to make excellent scouts, often taking the role of the first member of a group into danger and the last one out. Of course, walkers shine when adventuring in areas that match their many favored terrains, but many of the tricks they pick up in specific regions have application in a wide range of situations, allowing a horizon walker to be more mobile and resourceful than typical combatants.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Anyone can crave new vistas and constant travel, and thus a horizon walker can be of any alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-2">Requirements</h1>
<p>To qualify to become a horizon walker, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) 6 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Feats</strong>: <a href="#endurance">Endurance</a>.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-8">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the horizon walker prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A horizon walker gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Favored Terrain</strong>: At 1st level, a horizon walker may select a favored terrain from the ranger Favored Terrains table (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 65). This works exactly like the ranger favored terrain ability. The horizon walker gains an additional favored terrain at 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 10th level, and he can increase the bonus from an existing favored terrain as described in the ranger ability. If the horizon walker has abilities from other classes that only work in a favored terrain (such as a ranger's camouflage and hide in plain sight abilities), those abilities work in favored terrains selected as a horizon walker.</p>
<p><strong>Terrain Mastery</strong>: At 2nd level, a horizon walker selects a favored terrain to master. When within this terrain the horizon walker may, as a move action, grant a +2 bonus on <a href="#climb">Climb</a>, <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a>, <a href="#perception">Perception</a> and <a href="#survival">Survival</a> checks made by all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The character masters one additional terrain at 4th, 6th, and 8th levels.</p>
<p>Mastery of each terrain has additional benefits, outlined below; these benefits apply to the horizon walker at all times whether or not he is in the relevant terrain.</p>
<p><em>Astral Plane</em>: The horizon walker's fly speed increases by +30 feet on planes with no gravity or subjective gravity.</p>
<p><em>Cold</em>: The horizon walker gains cold resistance 10.</p>
<p><em>Desert</em>: The horizon walker gains immunity to exhaustion; anything that would cause him to become exhausted makes him fatigued instead.</p>
<p><em>Ethereal Plane</em>: The horizon walker ignores the 20% concealment miss chance from fog and mist, and treats total concealment from these sources as concealment.</p>
<p><em>Forest</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Jungle</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> checks and increases his CMD against grapple maneuvers by +4.</p>
<p><em>Mountain</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#climb">Climb</a> checks and does not lose his Dexterity modifier to AC while climbing.</p>
<p><em>Plains</em>: The horizon walker's movement is not reduced by wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Air</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#fly">Fly</a> checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against flying creatures. He gains the ability to breathe air if he cannot already do so.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Earth</em>: The horizon walker gains DR 1/adamantine.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Fire</em>: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Water</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#swim">Swim</a> checks and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against swimming creatures. He gains the ability to breathe water if he cannot already do so.</p>
<p><em>Plane, aligned</em>: If the horizon walker selects a plane with an alignment trait, he can choose to detect as that alignment (fooling all forms of magic divination) as an immediate action; this benefit lasts until he dismisses it (a free action).</p>
<p><em>Swamp</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Underground</em>: The horizon walker gains <a href="#blind-fight">Blind-Fight</a> as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><em>Urban</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks.</p>
<p><em>Water</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="#swim">Swim</a> checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against swimming creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Terrain Dominance</strong>: At 3rd level, a horizon walker learns total dominance over one terrain he has already selected for terrain mastery. When dealing with creatures native to that terrain, the horizon walker treats his favored terrain bonus for that terrain as a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class feature) against those creatures.This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) bonuses gained when fighting a favored enemy.</p>
<p>Each terrain dominance grants additional abilities, detailed below. When the horizon walker gains a new terrain dominance he may, if he prefers, instead pick an additional terrain mastery.</p>
<p><em>Astral Plane</em>: The horizon walker gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders. He gains <em><a href="#dimension-door">dimension door</a></em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).</p>
<p><em>Cold</em>: The horizon walker gains cold resistance 20 (this replaces the character's cold resistance from mastery of the cold terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against creatures of the cold subtype.</p>
<p><em>Desert</em>: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10 and immunity to fatigue.</p>
<p><em>Ethereal Plane</em>: The walker gains <em><a href="#ethereal-jaunt">ethereal jaunt</a></em> as a spell-like ability once per day (caster level equal to the character's level). He must be at least 7th level before selecting this power.</p>
<p><em>Forest</em>: The horizon walker gains <em><a href="#hallucinatory-terrain">hallucinatory terrain</a></em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). The horizon walker can only use this ability to create illusory forests.</p>
<p><em>Jungle</em>: The horizon walker gains <em><a href="#charm-monster">charm monster</a></em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). This charm only affects animals, magical beasts, and creatures primarily found in the jungle.</p>
<p><em>Mountain</em>: The horizon walker gains DR 2/adamantine.</p>
<p><em>Plains</em>: The walker's base speed increases by +10 feet.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Air</em>: The horizon walker gains <em><a href="../../spells/fly.html">fly</a></em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).</p>
<p><em>Plane of Earth</em>: The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a range of 30 feet. He must be at least 5th level before selecting this plane for this ability.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Fire</em>: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 20 (this replaces the character's file resistance from mastery of the Plane of Fire terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls again creatures of the fire subtype.</p>
<p><em>Plane of Water</em>: The horizon walker's movements and actions are not hampered when underwater. This allows him to speak, make attacks, and cast spells normally underwater (as if using <em><a href="#freedom-of-movement">freedom of movement</a></em>).</p>
<p><em>Plane, aligned</em>: For the purpose of bypassing damage reduction, the horizon walker's manufactured and natural weapons count as the opposite alignment of his chosen plane of dominance. If his chosen plane has more than one alignment type, he must choose one of those types for this ability. For example, if he selects “Hell” (an evil, lawful plane) for his terrain dominance ability, he may choose “evil” or “lawful,” which means his attacks bypass good or chaotic damage reduction, respectively. Alternatively, if native creatures of his chosen plane are vulnerable to a particular special material (such as cold iron or silver), he may choose to have his weapons bypass damage reduction as if they were that special material. If he selects this plane more than once for his terrain dominance ability, his attacks count as an additional alignment or special material (such as “good and silver” or “chaotic and good”).</p>
<p><em>Swamp</em>: The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a 30-foot range. He must be 5th level before selecting this power.</p>
<p><em>Underground</em>: The horizon walker gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision 60 feet, its range extends by 60 feet.</p>
<p><em>Urban</em>: The horizon walker gains <em><a href="#charm-person">charm person</a></em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).</p>
<p><em>Water</em>: The horizon walker gains a swim speed of 20 feet. If he already has a natural swim speed, his swim speed increases by +20 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Master of All Lands (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, the horizon walker becomes familiar with and comfortable in all possible terrains. His terrain bonus in all favored terrains increases by +2, and he treats all other terrains as if they were favored terrains (+2 bonus). If a naturally occurring condition of temperature or weather requires a check or saving throw, he automatically succeeds. All allies within 60 feet of him gain a +2 bonus on these checks and saves; if the horizon walker is in a mastered terrain, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p>Master Chymist</p>
<h1 id="master-chymist">Master Chymist</h1>
<p>When alchemists blithely use mutagens to turn themselves into hulking creatures of muscle and reflex, civilized folk often turn their heads and mutter that such transformations must have a price. For a few alchemists, that price is transformation into a master chymist, a creature able to take a monstrous brute form as an act of will.</p>
<p>Master chymists become two personalities sharing a single body. Both the hulking “mutagenic form” of alchemical prowess and the original alchemist who created it think of themselves as the true form, and they must learn to work together to achieve their joint goals. More often than not, master chymists eventually become their mutagenic form, and the original alchemist's body and mind may only be brought forth when required by social custom or a need for obscurity and stealth arises. Unfortunately, the mutagenic form of a master chymist is often a more violent, unforgiving personality (which can lead to conflict between the two versions of the same character).</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Master chymists are rarely accepted by society once their nature is revealed, and thus they have a strong motivation to keep on the move. Adventuring is one of the few activities that their monstrous form can be useful for, leading many to constantly explore dangerous areas on the edge of civilization. A master chymist's resilience and ability to combine bomb-throwing mayhem with up-close melee carnage is a great benefit to many adventuring parties, buying the master chymist allies who are at least willing to overlook her more distasteful features.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A master chymist actually has two alignments (see the mutagenic form ability). The only restriction on these alignments is that they cannot be exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-3">Requirements</h1>
<p>To qualify to become a master chymist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Ability to create 3rd-level extracts.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Mutagen class feature, feral mutagen or infuse mutagen discovery.</p>
<h1 id="class-skills-10">Class Skills</h1>
<p>The master chymist's class skills are <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> (Dex), <a href="#climb">Climb</a> (Str), <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> (Dex), <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> (Cha), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) (Int), <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> (Wis), <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> (Dex), and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> (Str).</p>

<h1 id="class-features-9">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the master chymist prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A master chymist gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Extracts per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a master chymist gains new extracts per day as if she had also gained a level in alchemist. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for extracts per day and an increased effective caster level for extracts.</p>
<p><strong>Bomb-Thrower (Ex)</strong>: The destructive power of bombs appeals to the violent urges of a master chymist. Add the character's alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine the damage done by her bombs.</p>
<p><strong>Mutagenic Form (Ex)</strong>: A master chymist's mutagenic form is an alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form, an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7/master chymist 4. Her mutagenic form is a deformed, twisted creature called Butcher. Butcher is neutral, and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same character is neutral, is not revealed by a <em><a href="#detect-good">detect good</a></em> spell, and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Mutate (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, as a result of repeated exposure to her mutagens, the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen. In this form, she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as with an <em><a href="#antimagic-field">antimagic field</a></em>), or she expends another use of her mutate ability.</p>
<p>A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability).</p>
<p>At 5th level, the master chymist can assume her mutagenic form three times per day; this increases to four times per day at 8th level and five times per day at 10th level.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Mutagen (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, the mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows in power. The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen, a power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form. She gains additional advanced mutagens at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level. The chymist cannot select the same advanced mutagen more than once.</p>
<p><em>Burly (Ex)</em>: In her mutagenic form, the master chymist's heavy physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks, Constitution checks, and Strength-based skill checks as well as a bonus to CMB and CMD. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.</p>
<p><em><a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> (Ex)</em>: When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10 minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form.</p>
<p><em>Draconic Mutagen (Su)</em>: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she gains dragon-like features—scaly skin, reptilian eyes, and so on, resembling a half-dragon. The chymist chooses one dragon type (see the <a href="#draconic">draconic bloodline</a>) when selecting this advanced mutagen; once selected, this choice cannot be changed and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type. The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type. The chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage (Reflex half, DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's Intelligence modifier); she may use her breath weapon once per transformation into her mutagenic form. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16, must know the <em><a href="#form-of-the-dragon-i">form of the dragon I</a></em> extract, and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Dual Mind (Ex)</em>: The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms. If she is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; if she succeeds, she is free of the effect (as if she had made her original save) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or back to her normal form. If she has no more uses of the mutate ability remaining for the day, she cannot use dual mind. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 10 to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Evasion (Ex)</em>: This mutagen functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it only applies in the chymist's mutagenic form.</p>
<p><em>Extended Mutagen (Ex)</em>: The duration of the master chymist's mutation is doubled.</p>
<p><em>Feral Mutagen (Ex)</em>: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens.</p>
<p><em><a href="#furious">Furious</a> Mutagen (Ex)</em>: The damage dice for the feral mutagen's bite and claw attacks increase by one die step. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 11 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Grand Mutagen (Ex)</em>: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Greater Mutagen (Ex)</em>: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 12 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Growth Mutagen (Su)</em>: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she increases one size category, as if under the effects of an <em><a href="#enlarge-person">enlarge person</a></em> spell. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 16 and must know the <em><a href="#enlarge-person">enlarge person</a></em>, <em><a href="#giant-form-i">giant form I</a></em>, or <em><a href="#polymorph">polymorph</a></em> extract to select this ability.</p>
<p><em>Night <a href="#vision">Vision</a> (Ex)</em>: The chymist gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision in her mutagenic form.</p>
<p><em>Nimble (Ex)</em>: The master chymist's lithe physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on all Dexterity checks, Dexterity skill checks, and CMD, and a natural armor bonus to her Armor Class. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.</p>
<p><em>Restoring Change (Su)</em>: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form or returns to her normal form from her mutagenic form, she heals a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + her character level.</p>
<p><em>Scent (Ex)</em>: The master chymist gains the scent ability in her mutagenic form.</p>
<p><strong>Brutality (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a master chymist's taste for violence leads her to strike more powerful blows with weapons easily mastered by her bestial mind. At 3rd level, a chymist in her mutagenic form deals +2 damage when attacking with simple weapons and natural attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and to +6 at 9th level.</p>
<p>Master Spy</p>
<h1 id="master-spy">Master Spy</h1>
<p>Unparalleled practitioners of deception, master spies rely on deceit and trickery over brawn and spells. A master spy is an expert at both magical and nonmagical means of evading detection, and quick-witted when it comes to improvisation. Master spies may serve countries or private interests, or sell their services to the highest bidder without a thought to long-term loyalty.</p>
<p>Bards and rogues, with their wide range of skills, are particularly well suited for the demands of spying. Rogues can easily pass themselves off as members of most nonmagical professions (though playing an armored warrior impedes their natural abilities), while bluffing bards can impersonate a wide range of other spellcasters well enough to fool a casual observer. Versatility and adaptability are the watchwords for espionage, and successful master spies let others complete their deception for them, subtly drawing targets into their machinations.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Master spies rarely work with others unless they are under cover. The special skills that serve them so well in the field ironically make them exceptional leaders, but a master spy's natural inclination toward secrecy pushes her away from the limelight. Note that a master spy among adventurers may not intend to betray them; armed heroes provide excellent cover for a master spy's true mission, whether or not they know the spy's intent.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: The practice of espionage demands discipline and a certain amount of moral and ethical flexibility; more master spies are neutral than lawful or chaotic.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-10">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the master spy prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A master spy gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Art of Deception (Ex)</strong>: A master spy adds her class level to all <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a>, and <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Master of <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> (Ex)</strong>: A master spy can create a disguise in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or size are reduced by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.</p>
<p><strong>Glib Lie (Su)</strong>: A master spy of 2nd level or higher can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as if she were under the effect of a <em><a href="#glibness">glibness</a></em> spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy the <em><a href="#glibness">glibness</a></em> spell's bonus on <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Mask Alignment (Su)</strong>: A master spy of 2nd level or higher can alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as <em><a href="#detect-evil">detect evil</a></em>). She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Nonmagical Aura (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, a master spy can use <em><a href="#magic-aura">magic aura</a></em> twice per day, but only for the purpose of making an object appear nonmagical.</p>
<p><strong>Superficial <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (Ex)</strong>: A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at 3rd level, she can make untrained <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> and <a href="#profession">Profession</a> checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman can make untrained <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (history) checks about the kingdom and <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nobility) checks about its noble and royal families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) skill checks to identify herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Concealed Thoughts (Su)</strong>: A 4th-level master spy can conceal her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using <em><a href="#detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a></em> or similar magic to read her mind, she decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than surface thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Change (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, a master spy can assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a -10 penalty on her <a href="#disguise">Disguise</a> check. This penalty drops to -5 at 8th level.</p>
<p><strong>Elude Detection (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a <em><a href="#nondetection">nondetection</a></em> spell with a caster level equal to her character level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the <em><a href="#nondetection">nondetection</a></em> for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Mind (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a master spy can slip away from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use slippery mind once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Shift Alignment (Su)</strong>: Starting at 6th level, a master spy's control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by <em><a href="#holy-smite">holy smite</a></em> with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Death Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a master spy learns the art of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the master spy has levels in another class that grants the death attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet reached 8th level as a master spy.</p>
<p><strong>Fool Casting (Su)</strong>: A master spy of 8th level or higher can trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as <em><a href="#charm-person">charm person</a></em>, <em><a href="#dominate-person">dominate person</a></em>, or a vampire's dominate ability), she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Mind (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a master spy gains the benefit of a constant <em><a href="#mind-blank">mind blank</a></em> spell at a caster level equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the <em><a href="#mind-blank">mind blank</a></em> for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption (Su)</strong>: The ultimate ability of the master spy is to take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and shift her aura to that of her target. This confuses divination effects and spells, even ones as powerful as <em><a href="#discern-location">discern location</a></em>, such that they register the spy as being the creature she has touched. This ability is not proof against the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings. The assumption of an identity lasts until the master spy ends it (a standard action) or she uses the ability on another creature.</p>
<p>Nature Warden</p>
<h1 id="nature-warden">Nature Warden</h1>
<p>Nature wardens are guardians of the wild places of the world, hunters and explorers par excellence, highly skilled in negotiating their way among the nonhuman inhabitants of the wild. Nature wardens befriend and train a beast of the wild as a companion, and some call wardens “beastmasters” because of these pets, but nature wardens are much more than tamers of wild things. They are experts at navigating the harsh brutality of nature's fury and making do with whatever tools and weapons present themselves, but they go beyond being hardy survivalists to become cunning tacticians with keen analytical minds, able to adapt and prepare for any situation and make the absolute best use of the advantages that any terrain or environment can afford them.</p>
<p>Nature wardens are usually druids or ranger/druids, though occasional ranger/clerics with the Animal domain or even single-classed high-level rangers or multiclassed rangers explore this class.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: The nature warden is a master of wilderness environments and is at her most powerful in any of the variety of environments that she has studied. She and her animal companion form a potent team. They are excellent scouts and versatile warriors, able to supplement their skills with spells to fulfill almost any role.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Nature wardens tend toward nonevil alignments, as many pursue their profession out of a desire to help and protect others. Occasionally evil wardens can be found turning the bitter realities of the wild upon their enemies or guarding natural sites tainted by dark fey.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-5">Requirements</h1>
<p>To qualify to become a nature warden, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +4.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Animal companion class feature*, favored terrain class feature, wild empathy class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> 5 ranks, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) 5 ranks, <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) 5 ranks, <a href="#survival">Survival</a> 5 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Able to cast 2nd-level divine spells.</p>
<p>* An oracle of nature's bonded mount ability counts as an animal companion class ability for the purpose of this prestige class.</p>
<h1 id="class-skills-12">Class Skills</h1>
<p>The nature warden's class skills are <a href="#climb">Climb</a> (Str), <a href="#handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> (Cha), <a href="#heal">Heal</a> (Wis), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) (Int), <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) (Int), <a href="#perception">Perception</a> (Wis), <a href="#ride">Ride</a> (Dex), <a href="#sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> (Wis), <a href="#survival">Survival</a> (Wis), and <a href="#swim">Swim</a> (Str).</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks at Each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-11">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the nature warden prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A nature warden gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a nature warden gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a nature warden, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.</p>
<p><strong>Companion Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a nature warden's class levels stack with levels in all classes that grant an animal companion for the purpose of determining her animal companion's abilities. The nature warden and her animal companion have an empathic link like that between a wizard and his familiar. At 5th level, the nature warden's animal companion gains the same benefits the warden does when in the warden's favored terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Empathy (Ex)</strong>: For the purpose of the wild empathy ability, a nature warden's class level stacks with levels in all classes with the wild empathy ability. When in her favored terrain, a nature warden adds her favored terrain bonus to wild empathy checks. She may also choose to use wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast rather than improving its attitude, as if using <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> rather than <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>.</p>
<p>At 4th level, a nature warden no longer suffers a penalty when using wild empathy to influence or demoralize magical beasts. At 7th level, she may use wild empathy to affect vermin (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2). At 10th level, she may use it to affect plant creatures (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2).</p>
<p><strong>Mystic Harmony (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a nature warden in her favored terrain gains an insight bonus to AC equal to half her favored terrain bonus. She loses this bonus when she is immobilized or helpless.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Stride (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a nature warden and her animal companion gain the ability to move through natural hazards of her favored terrain (such as bogs, loose sand, snow, ice, rockslides, and so on) at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment (in effect, this is the woodland stride ability applied to non-plant environmental hazards). Terrain hazards that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Speech (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, a nature warden can <em><a href="#speak-with-animals">speak with animals</a></em>at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use <em><a href="#speak-with-animals">speak with animals</a></em>once per day. Her caster level is equal to her class level.</p>
<p><strong>Silverclaw (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a nature warden's animal companion and any creature she summons with <em>summon nature's ally</em>gain DR/silver equal to the warden's class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Favored Terrain (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level and again at 10th level, a nature warden may choose a favored terrain. This ability is identical to and stacks with the ranger class ability.</p>
<p><strong>Survivalist (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a nature warden suffers no penalty for using an improvised weapon or improvised tool. At 10th level, a warden can spend 1 minute examining and adjusting an improvised weapon or tool; thereafter she treats it as a masterwork weapon or tool.</p>
<p><strong>Woodforging (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, a nature warden can manufacture wooden items which she may use with surpassing skill. Once per day, she may use <em><a href="#wood-shape">wood shape</a></em>as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her nature warden level. In her hands, items created with this ability are treated as masterwork items under the effect of an <em><a href="#ironwood">ironwood</a></em>spell; in the hands of others, they are merely ordinary wooden items of the appropriate type. If the warden uses this ability to create armor or weapons, she may craft them into magic items as if she had the <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a> feat (though they are merely magical wood in the hands of others, and only ironwood when she uses them).</p>
<p><strong>Companion Walk (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, the nature warden's companion shares the benefits of travel spells (such as <em><a href="#tree-stride">tree stride</a></em> and <em><a href="#transport-via-plants">transport via plants</a></em>) and polymorph and similar spells (including <em><a href="#tree-shape">tree shape</a></em>) cast by the warden from the druid or ranger spell list. The companion counts either as part of the warden or as an object with no weight, whichever is more favorable for the warden.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Speech (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, a nature warden can cast <em><a href="#speak-with-plants">speak with plants</a></em>at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use <em><a href="#speak-with-plants">speak with plants</a></em>once per day as a spell-like ability. Her caster level is equal to her class level.</p>
<p><strong>Ironpaw (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a nature warden may grant her animal companion and any creature she summons with <em>summon nature's ally</em> DR/cold iron equal to her class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability does not stack with the silverclaw ability. The warden must decide at the time of summoning whether a summoned creature gains the benefits of silverclaw or ironpaw. She may change which ability applies to her animal companion by spending 1 hour in prayer and meditation with the companion within 100 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Guarded Lands (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a nature warden may designate an area as her guarded lands, allowing her to treat it as her favored terrain or to enhance her bonuses if it is already in her favored terrain. The area must be no larger than 1 square mile, and the warden must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area. This period of study gives her a +2 favored terrain bonus in that area, which stacks with any favored terrain bonus for that area (for example, she also gets her forest favored terrain bonus if her guarded lands are part of a forest). She may also designate one creature type as her favored enemy within those guarded lands, gaining a +2 favored enemy bonus against the creature type that stacks with any favored enemy bonus she has against that type of creature. Allies who can see and hear the warden gain an initiative bonus equal to half the warden's favored terrain bonus for that terrain.</p>
<p>A nature warden may have a number of guarded lands equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When she reaches her maximum number of guarded lands, she can select a new guarded land by abandoning an existing one and performing the ritual for a new area.</p>
<p><strong>Companion Soul (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a nature warden's bond with her animal companion is so strong that it transcends distance and even death. The companion's devotion ability increases to a +8 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. The warden may scry on her animal companion once per day as if using the <em><a href="#scrying">scrying</a></em> spell, except she needs no focus or divine focus. She may view the area around her companion or see through its eyes. If her companion dies, she can revive it with an 8-hour ritual; this has the same effect as <em><a href="#raise-dead">raise dead</a></em>, except it doesn't require a material component and the companion does not gain any negative levels from the ordeal.</p>
<p>Rage Prophet</p>
<h1 id="rage-prophet">Rage Prophet</h1>
<p>Throughout the wilderness, there are those warriors whose powers are infused by the spirits, who see and hear into the world beyond and draw unthinkable reserves of power from it. They are the chosen of the gods, and they often hold status nearly equal to that of a chief or shaman in a typical tribe, or sometimes even exceeding this. Rage prophets can dispense advice through their communion with the spirits and ability to divine the future.</p>
<p>Rage prophets are always barbarian/oracles, though some have levels in other classes as well. The most popular oracle mystery among rage prophets is that of battle, for skill in battle is respected in barbarian society, but oracles of all mysteries find their way into positions as war-chiefs, counselors, and leaders. Some rage prophets choose to live apart or to act as wandering champions, belonging to all tribes and none, following the lead of their spirit guides rather than the dictates of any one tribal chief or council. Though sometimes looked at askance by tribal leaders, these wanderers are popular with many barbarians, who see them as the perfect exemplars of the strength, virtue, and power of the free folk, owing nothing to anyone but the sky above, the earth beneath, and the spirits within.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: The rage prophet has considerable spellcasting ability, but it usually serves as a conduit to enhance his fighting prowess. His combat skills are considerable and his ability to keep himself going in any fight and to focus his physical rage into supernatural power gives him an unexpected boost in power and versatility to overcome any challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Rage prophets may be of any nonlawful alignment, but chaotic alignments are more common, as they are in the barbarian tribes from which they hail. Wandering rage prophets are usually chaotic, living apart from any tribe and the tribal structure of their heritage as they take up the adventuring life.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-12">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the rage prophet prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A rage prophet gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a rage prophet gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a rage prophet, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.</p>
<p><strong>Savage Seer</strong>: A rage prophet's class level stacks with barbarian levels for determining the effect of rage powers, and with oracle levels for determining the effect of oracle revelations and his oracle's curse. This does not grant additional abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit Guide (Sp)</strong>: Every rage prophet possesses a spirit guide, an insubstantial phantom that speaks to his mind, watches over him, and lends him its strength and wisdom. Whenever the rage prophet rages, he gains the benefit of a single <em><a href="#guidance">guidance</a></em>spell from his spirit guide; this bonus can be used at any time during his rage. The spirit guide also allows the rage prophet to use <em><a href="#dancing-lights">dancing lights</a></em>, <em><a href="#ghost-sound">ghost sound</a></em>, and <em><a href="#mage-hand">mage hand</a></em> as spell-like abilities once per day each (caster level equal to the rage prophet's class level). The DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p><strong>Rage Prophet Mystery</strong>: At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, a rage prophet learns an additional spell from his spirit guide. These spells are in addition to those listed in Table 2-6: Oracle Spells Known. Like spells from an oracle's mystery, the rage prophet cannot exchange these spells for different spells at higher levels. The rage prophet must be able to cast oracle spells of the listed level to learn one of these spells from his spirit guide. The rage prophet treats the spell as an oracle spell of the listed level. The possible spells are <em><a href="#arcane-eye">arcane eye</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#augury">augury</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#divination">divination</a></em> (4th), <em><a href="#dream">dream</a></em> (5th), <em><a href="#find-the-path">find the path</a></em> (6th), <em><a href="#helping-hand">helping hand</a></em> (3rd), <em><a href="#see-invisibility">see invisibility</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#shadow-walk">shadow walk</a></em> (6th), <em><a href="#speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a></em> (3rd), <em><a href="#spectral-hand">spectral hand</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#spiritual-weapon">spiritual weapon</a></em> (2nd), <em><a href="#unseen-servant">unseen servant</a></em> (1st), <em><a href="#vision">vision</a></em> (7th), and <em><a href="#whispering-wind">whispering wind</a></em> (2nd).</p>
<p><strong>Raging Healer (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a rage prophet is able to cast <em>cure</em> spells on himself while raging, without having to use clarity of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Indomitable Caster (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a rage prophet adds his Constitution bonus (if any) on concentration checks.</p>
<p><strong>Ragecaster (Su)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, a rage prophet's spells grow more potent when he rages. When using moment of clarity, he adds his barbarian level to his caster level. At 7th level, he adds his Constitution bonus to the save DC of any spells cast while raging.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit Guardian (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, the competence bonus provided by the spirit guide's <em><a href="#guidance">guidance</a></em>spell increases to half the rage prophet's class level when used while battling a fey, outsider, undead, or incorporeal creature. As a swift action, the rage prophet can spend 1 round of rage (whether he is raging or not) to give his armor and weapons the <em><a href="#weapons-ghost-touch">ghost touch</a></em> property for 1 round; this effect ends if the item is no longer in his possession.</p>
<p><strong>Enduring Rage (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, as a free action, a rage prophet can extend the duration of his rage by sacrificing a spell slot; this prolongs the duration of his rage for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot used.</p>
<p><strong>Raging Spellstrength (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a rage prophet is able to cast spells with a range of “personal” on himself while raging, without having to use clarity of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit Warrior (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, the competence bonus provided by the rage prophet's <em><a href="#guidance">guidance</a></em>increases to his rage prophet level when used while battling a fey, outsider, undead, or incorporeal creature. His ability to give his armor and weapons the <em><a href="#weapons-ghost-touch">ghost touch</a></em> property becomes an immediate action instead of a swift action.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, when a rage prophet enters a rage, his morale bonus to Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3.</p>
<p>Stalwart Defender</p>
<h1 id="stalwart-defender">Stalwart Defender</h1>
<p>Drawn from the ranks of guards, knights, mercenaries, and thugs alike, stalwart defenders are masters of claiming an area and refusing to relinquish it. This behavior is more than a tactical decision for stalwart defenders; it's an obsessive, stubborn expression of the need to be undefeated. When stalwart defenders set themselves in a defensive stance, they place their whole effort into weathering whatever foe, conflict, or threat comes their way.</p>
<p>Most stalwart defenders come from the ranks of fighters, often those desiring to be better guards for friends and allies. Dwarves are particularly suited to the role, though stalwart defenders of all races exist. More rarely, barbarians take the path of the stalwart defender as a matter of pride, to overcome some perceived shortcoming. Such characters often seem to suffer from dual personalities, flinging themselves recklessly into combat one moment, then calmly fending off all attackers the next.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Stalwart defenders are masters of melee combat, striving to prove that the best offense is a good defense. Stalwart defenders are normally found on the front lines of battle, holding a position to cover their allies, leaping into breaches of opposing formations and holding them open for others, and guarding more vulnerable allies by acting as mobile fortifications, stable points in the ever-changing chaos of battle.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Anyone can be as stubborn as a rock and dedicated to holding one point no matter the cost, so stalwart defenders can be of any alignment. The dedication and practice required to learn the talents of a stalwart defender come more easily to characters with a strong respect for order and organization, however, so lawful stalwart defenders are much more common than chaotic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d12.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-7">Requirements</h1>
<p>To qualify to become a stalwart defender, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +7.</p>

<p><strong>Special</strong>: Proficiency with light and medium armor.</p>

<h1 id="class-features-13">Class Features</h1>
<p>The following are class features of the stalwart defender prestige class.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A stalwart defender is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields (including tower shields).</p>
<p><strong>AC Bonus (Ex)</strong>: A stalwart defender receives a dodge bonus to AC that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Stance (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trancelike determination. A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like <em><a href="#bear-s-endurance">bear's endurance</a></em>, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<p>While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> skill or an enchantment spell, his stance ends.</p>
<p>The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
<p>A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the <em><a href="#rage">rage</a></em> spell).</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Powers (Ex)</strong>: As a stalwart defender gains levels, he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance, and some of these powers require him to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
<p><em>Bulwark (Ex)</em>: The defender adds his armor check penalty as a bonus to the DC of opponents attempting to <a href="#bluff">Bluff</a> him and <a href="#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks to pass by him without provoking an attack of opportunity for moving through spaces he threatens.</p>
<p><em>Clear Mind (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The stalwart defender must take the second result, even if it is worse. This power can only be used once per defensive stance.</p>
<p><em>Fearless Defense (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.</p>
<p><em>Halting Blow (Ex)</em>: If a foe's movement in the defender's threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity and the stalwart defender successfully hits the foe with the attack, the foe's movement ends immediately. The foe cannot move again until its next turn but can still take the rest of its action. A stalwart defender must have selected the bulwark power prior to selecting halting blow.</p>
<p><em>Immobile (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender adds his class level to his CMD against any bull rush, overrun, pull, and push combat maneuvers, as well as grapple attempts to move him. The stalwart defender must be at least 4th level to select this power.</p>
<p><em>Increased Damage Reduction (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender's damage reduction from this class increases by 1/—. This increase is always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before selecting this defensive power.</p>
<p><em>Intercept (Ex)</em>: Once a round as an immediate action, when a melee or ranged weapon would successfully strike an adjacent ally, the stalwart defender can choose to have the weapon strike him instead of the intended target. The attack automatically hits the stalwart defender, regardless his AC or any miss chance in effect, and he suffers the normal consequences of the attack.</p>
<p><em>Internal Fortitude (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.</p>
<p><em>Mighty Resilience (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from <a href="#blinding-critical">Blinding Critical</a> or bleed from sneak attack). The stalwart defender takes only normal damage from the attack. This power may only be used once per defensive stance. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level to select this power.</p>
<p><em>Renewed Defense (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, the stalwart defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only while in a defensive stance.</p>
<p><em>Roused Defense (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance.</p>
<p><em><a href="#smash-(combat)">Smash</a> (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus -5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple; this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.</p>
<p><em>Unexpected Strike (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance. A stalwart defender must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flatfooted, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
<p>If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a stalwart defender gains DR 1/—. At 7th level, this DR increases to 3/—, and at 10th level it increases to 5/—. Damage reduction from different sources does not stack; however, a stalwart defender of 5th or higher level that gains DR from armor (but not from any other source) increases his class-based DR by the value of the armor's DR. Thus a 7th-level stalwart defender wearing adamantine full plate (DR 3/—) has DR 6/—.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Uncanny <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a> (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a stalwart defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).</p>
<p>If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a stalwart defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.</p>
<p><strong>Last Word (Ex)</strong>: Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender can make one melee attack against an opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the defender's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability.</p>
<h1 id="feats">Feats</h1>
<p>Feats represent a special trick or ability a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his or her birth. They grant characters abilities others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most can be taken by anyone who meets the prerequisites. The feats in this book expand upon those in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook,</em>including a host of new combat feats and metamagic feats. In addition, this chapter also introduces teamwork feats, which function only when two characters with the same feat work together.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-feats">Types of Feats</h1>
<p>While most of the feats presented here are general, and have no special rules governing them, some feats have a category associated with them that involves special rules. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="combat-feats">Combat Feats</h2>
<p>Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming they meet the prerequisites.</p>
<h2 id="metamagic-feats"><a href="#table-advanced-metamagic-feats-table">Metamagic Feats</a></h2>
<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting them new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork-feats"><a href="#table-teamwork-feats">Teamwork Feats</a></h2>
<p>Teamwork feats grant large bonuses, but they only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally who also possesses the feat to be positioned carefully on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats.</p>
<h1 id="feat-descriptions">Feat Descriptions</h1>
<p>Feats are summarized on the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' description for full details.</p>
<p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Feat Name</strong>: The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: What a feat enables the character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.</p>
<p><strong>Normal</strong>: What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Additional unusual facts about the feat.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a bouncing spell targeting a single creature has no effect on its intended target (whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw) you may, as a swift action, redirect it to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its new target were the original target for the spell.

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use the total defense action while using a light, heavy, or tower shield, you can provide a cover bonus to AC against all attacks to an adjacent ally your size or smaller.

<h2 id="crippling-critical-combat">Crippling Critical (Combat)</h2>
<p>You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_critical-focus">Critical Focus</a>, base attack bonus +13.</p>

<p><strong>Special:</strong> Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select <a href="#crossbow-mastery">Crossbow Mastery</a> as a combat style feat.</p>
<h2 id="dastardly-finish-combat">Dastardly Finish (Combat)</h2>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can choose to take a –5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to daze opponents you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack.

You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.</p>
<h2 id="dazing-spell-metamagic">Dazing Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
<p>You can daze creatures with the power of your spells.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A dazing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.</p>
<h2 id="deep-drinker">Deep Drinker</h2>
<p>You draw greater amounts of <em>ki</em> from your libations.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack.

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities (DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell's effects avoid this feat's effect as well. A disruptive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<h2 id="diviners-delving">Diviner's Delving</h2>
<p>Your keen magical intuition makes reading signs, portents, and mystical clues quick and easy.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_spell-focus">Spell Focus</a> (divination).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with divinations to overcome spell resistance or effects that impede divination (for example, <em><a href="../spells/nondetection.html#_nondetection">nondetection</a></em>). When using a divination spell that requires concentration, you gain information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of concentration, and information from the third round in the second round of concentration).</p>
<h2 id="dreadful-carnage-combat">Dreadful Carnage (Combat)</h2>
<p>Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.</p>

Enemies that cannot see both you and the enemy you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are unaffected.</p>
<h2 id="duck-and-cover-teamwork">Duck and Cover (Teamwork)</h2>
<p>Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, and both of you are required to make a Reflex saving throw against a spell or effect, you may take the result of your die roll or that of your ally (your modifiers still apply to the roll, regardless of which result you take). If you take your ally's result, you are knocked prone (or staggered on your next turn, if you are already prone or cannot be knocked prone). In addition, you receive a +2 cover bonus to your AC against ranged attacks as long as your ally is wielding a shield.</p>
<h2 id="eagle-eyes">Eagle Eyes</h2>

On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally plus 1d6 points of damage of the chosen type. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You may attempt an elemental fist attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (see Special), and no more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A monk of the four winds receives <a href="#elemental-fist">Elemental Fist</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.

Once made, these choices cannot be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can only take this feat if you possess levels in a class whose spellcasting relies on a limited list of spells known, such as the bard, oracle, and sorcerer.</p>

<p>You can cast a single low-level spell as a spell-like ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="#minor-spell-expertise">Minor Spell Expertise</a>, ability to cast 9th-level spells.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one spell that you know of 5th level or lower. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You receive a +2 bonus on <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) checks, and you may create mundane alchemical items much more quickly than normal. When making poisons, you can create a number of doses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at one time. These additional doses do not increase the time required, but they do increase the raw material cost.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever you make alchemical items or poisons using <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> (alchemy), use the item's gp value as its sp value when determining your progress (do not multiply the item's gp cost by 10 to determine its sp cost).</p>
<h2 id="merciful-spell-metamagic">Merciful Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
<p>Your damaging spells subdue rather than kill.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can alter spells that inflict damage to inflict nonlethal damage instead. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict nonlethal damage of that same type. A merciful spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.</p>
<h2 id="minor-spell-expertise">Minor Spell Expertise</h2>
<p>You are able to cast a 1st-level spell as a spell-like ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ability to cast 4th-level spells.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one 1st-level spell that you know. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.</p>

<p>You are skilled at deflecting ranged attacks with your shield.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, <a href="../feats.html#_shield-focus">Shield Focus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon (not including spell effects, natural attacks, or massive ranged weapons), you may deflect it so that you take no damage, as if you had the <a href="../feats.html#_deflect-arrows">Deflect Arrows</a> feat. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.</p>
<h2 id="mounted-shield-combat">Mounted Shield (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your defensive tactics defend both you and your mount.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_shield-focus">Shield Focus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may add your base shield bonus (including the bonus from <a href="../feats.html#_shield-focus">Shield Focus</a> but not including enhancement bonuses) to your mount's AC. In addition, you may add this bonus when making a <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> check to negate a hit against your mount using the <a href="../feats.html#_mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a> feat.</p>
<h2 id="mounted-skirmisher-combat">Mounted Skirmisher (Combat)</h2>
<p>You are adept at attacking from upon a swift moving steed.</p>

<h2 id="outflank-combat-teamwork">Outflank (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
<p>You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +4.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same creature, your flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to +4. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit against the flanked creature, it provokes an attack of opportunity from your ally.</p>
<h2 id="paired-opportunists-combat-teamwork">Paired Opportunists (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
<p>You know how to make an enemy pay for lax defenses.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity against creatures that you both threaten. Enemies that provoke attacks of opportunity from your ally also provoke attacks of opportunity from you so long as you threaten them (even if the situation or an ability would normally deny you the attack of opportunity). This does not allow you to take more than one attack of opportunity against a creature for a given action.</p>
<h2 id="parry-spell">Parry Spell</h2>
<p>You can throw an enemy spell back at its caster.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> 15 ranks, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-counterspell">Improved Counterspell</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you successfully counter a spell, it returns back to its caster. This works exactly like the <em><a href="../spells/spellTurning.html#_spell-turning">spell turning</a></em> spell.</p>

<p>You are an expert skirmisher, able to rain missiles upon your enemies whether advancing or retreating.</p>

<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You cannot attack when using the withdraw action.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select <a href="#parting-shot">Parting Shot</a> as a combat style feat.</p>
<h2 id="pass-for-human">Pass For Human</h2>
<p>You're easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your own race.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You receive a +10 bonus on <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise">Disguise</a> checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise">Disguise</a> check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A halfling may take this feat, but must have the <a href="#childlike">Childlike</a> feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats stack.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-strike-combat">Perfect Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>When wielding a monk weapon, your attacks can be extremely precise.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, Wis 13, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A weapon master monk or zen archer monk receives <a href="#perfect-strike">Perfect Strike</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt an perfect strike attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.</p>
<h2 id="persistent-spell-metamagic">Persistent Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
<p>You can modify a spell to become more tenacious when its targets resist its effect.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<p>Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.</p>
<h2 id="point-blank-master-combat">Point Blank Master (Combat)</h2>
<p>You are adept at firing ranged weapons in close quarters.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_weapon-specialization">Weapon Specialization</a> with selected ranged weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Special:</strong> Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select <a href="#point-blank-master">Point Blank Master</a> as a combat style feat, but he must have <a href="../feats.html#_weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> instead of <a href="../feats.html#_weapon-specialization">Weapon Specialization</a> in the selected weapon.</p>
<h2 id="practiced-tactician">Practiced Tactician</h2>

<h2 id="preferred-spell">Preferred Spell</h2>
<p>You find it very easy to cast one particular spell.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> 5 ranks, <a href="../feats.html#_heighten-spell">Heighten Spell</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one spell which you have the ability to cast. You can cast that spell spontaneously by sacrificing a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level. You can apply any metamagic feats you possess to this spell when you cast it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell or spell slot you must sacrifice in order to cast it but does not affect the casting time.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different spell.</p>
<h2 id="punishing-kick-combat">Punishing Kick (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your kicks are so powerful you use them to push or knock back your foes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 13, Wis 13, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to knock them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt to knock the target prone, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the effect. You may attempt a punishing kick attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A hungry ghost monk receives <a href="#punishing-kick">Punishing Kick</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a punishing kick attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-assault-combat">Pushing Assault (Combat)</h2>
<p>A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 15, <a href="../feats.html#_power-attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modified by the <a href="../feats.html#_power-attack">Power Attack</a> feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from <a href="../feats.html#_power-attack">Power Attack</a>. If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.</p>
<h2 id="racial-heritage">Racial Heritage</h2>
<p>The blood of a non-human ancestor flows in your veins.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Human.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose another humanoid race. You count as both human and that race for any effects related to race.

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 15, <a href="#missile-shield">Missile Shield</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_spellbreaker">Spellbreaker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged touch attack (including rays and similar magical effects), you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. Your shield suffers the full effects of the spell or effect, if applicable.</p>
<h2 id="razortusk">Razortusk</h2>
<p>Your powerful jaws and steely teeth are deadly enough to give you a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Half-orc.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can make a bite attack for 1d4 points of damage, plus your Strength modifier. You're considered proficient in this attack and can apply feats or effects appropriate to natural attacks to it. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack and is made at your full base attack bonus –5, and adds half your Strength modifier to damage.</p>
<h2 id="reach-spell-metamagic">Reach Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
<p>Your spells go farther than normal.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modified by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.</p>
<p>Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.</p>
<h2 id="rending-claws-combat">Rending Claws (Combat)</h2>

If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may move your opponent as if from the reposition combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You must perform a reposition combat maneuver to reposition an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: <a href="#bull-rush-strike">Bull Rush Strike</a>, <a href="#disarming-strike">Disarming Strike</a>, <a href="#repositioning-strike">Repositioning Strike</a>, <a href="#sundering-strike">Sundering Strike</a>, or <a href="#tripping-strike">Tripping Strike</a>.

These targets are excluded from the effects of your spell. A selective spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<p>Spells that do not have an area of effect do not benefit from this feat.</p>
<h2 id="shadow-strike-combat">Shadow Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>You accurately strike even those you cannot clearly see.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_shield-proficiency">Shield Proficiency</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are wielding a shield and are adjacent to an ally wielding a shield who also has this feat, the AC bonus from your shield increases, depending on the shield wielded by your ally. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield, your shield bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy shield or a tower shield, your shield bonus increases by +2. You keep these bonuses even if your ally loses his shield bonus due to making a shield bash attack. If an adjacent ally with this feat uses a tower shield to grant total cover, you also benefit if an attack targeting you passes through the edge of the shield (<em>Core Rulebook</em>153).</p>
<h2 id="shielded-caster-teamwork">Shielded Caster (Teamwork)</h2>
<p>Your allies cover you while you cast complicated spells.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 competence bonus on concentration checks. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield, this bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy shield or a tower shield, this bonus increases by +2.

<h2 id="sickening-spell-metamagic">Sickening Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
<p>You can sicken creatures with your spells.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A sickening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>

<h2 id="smash-combat">Smash (Combat)</h2>
<p>You overcome obstacles by breaking them.</p>

<h2 id="sociable">Sociable</h2>
<p>You have a way of helping others to get along.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 13, half-elf.</p>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Pick one spell which you have the ability to cast. Whenever you cast that spell you may apply any one metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting its level or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell does not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you have other feats which allow you to apply a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this spell (such as <a href="../feats.html#_spell-focus">Spell Focus</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_spell-penetration">Spell Penetration</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> [ray], and so on), double the bonus granted by that feat when applied to this spell.</p>

<p>You can clear the way to continue using your bow.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_rapid-shot">Rapid Shot</a>, elf.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When adjacent to an opponent and making a full-attack action with a longbow or shortbow (including composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the attack hits—whether or not it does damage—your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from <a href="../feats.html#_rapid-shot">Rapid Shot</a>, and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a –2 penalty. If your initial attack leaves you with no enemies threatening you, you can make the subsequent ranged attack or attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="steel-soul">Steel Soul</h2>
<p>You are especially resistant to magic.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dwarf, hardy racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You receive a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. This replaces the normal bonus from the dwarf's hardy racial trait.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Dwarves normally receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities.</p>
<h2 id="step-up-and-strike-combat">Step Up and Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>When a foe tries to move away, you can follow and make an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 13, <a href="#following-step">Following Step</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_step-up">Step Up</a>, base attack bonus +6.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the <a href="../feats.html#_step-up">Step Up</a> or <a href="#following-step">Following Step</a> feats to follow an adjacent foe, you may also make a single melee attack against that foe at your highest base attack bonus. This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round. Using this feat does not count toward the number of actions you can usually take each round.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You can usually only take one standard action and one 5-foot step each round.</p>
<h2 id="stone-faced">Stone-Faced</h2>
<p>Rocks show more expression than you.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You receive a +4 bonus on <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> checks to lie or conceal your feelings or true motives, but not to feint in combat or deliver secret messages. In addition, the DC for <a href="../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks to get a hunch about you is 25 rather than 20.</p>
<h2 id="stone-sense">Stone Sense</h2>
<p>You can feel movement in the very earth and stones around you.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="#improved-stonecunnin">Improved Stonecunning</a>, <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> 10 ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain tremorsense to a range of 10 feet.</p>
<h2 id="stone-singer">Stone Singer</h2>
<p>Your songs are in accordance with the ways and lands of your people.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 13, bardic performance class feature, dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use bardic performance with audible components underground, the range or area of your chosen performance is doubled, and you can affect deaf creatures if they possess tremorsense and are in your new range. In addition, the DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2 for creatures of the earth subtype, regardless of where the performance occurs.</p>
<h2 id="stunning-assault-combat">Stunning Assault (Combat)</h2>
<p>You powerful but imprecise attacks can stun your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 13, <a href="../feats.html#_power-attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +16.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can choose to take a –5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to stun targets you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + your base attack bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.</p>
<h2 id="summoners-call">Summoner's Call</h2>
<p>Whenever you summon your eidolon, it is more powerful for a brief period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Eidolon class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you summon your eidolon, you may give it a +2 enhancement bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus lasts 10 minutes after the summoning ritual is complete.</p>
<h2 id="sundering-strike-combat">Sundering Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>Your critical hits can sunder your foes' weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 13, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-sunder">Improved Sunder</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_power-attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +9.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can sunder your opponent's weapon, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may deal damage to your opponent's weapon as if from the sunder combat maneuver (roll normal damage to the weapon separately). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You must perform a sunder combat maneuver to sunder an opponent's weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: <a href="#bull-rush-strike">Bull Rush Strike</a>, <a href="#disarming-strike">Disarming Strike</a>, <a href="#repositioning-strike">Repositioning Strike</a>, <a href="#sundering-strike">Sundering Strike</a>, or <a href="#tripping-strike">Tripping Strike</a>. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.</p>
<h2 id="swap-places-combat-teamwork">Swap Places (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
<p>You are skilled at changing places with your ally during a chaotic melee.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can move into your ally's square as part of normal movement. At the same time, your ally moves into your previous space as an immediate action. Both you and your ally must be willing and able to move to take advantage of this feat. Your ally must be the same size as you to utilize this feat. Your ally does not provoke an attack of opportunity from this movement, but you provoke as normal. This movement does not count against your ally's movement on his next turn.</p>
<h2 id="swift-aid-combat">Swift Aid (Combat)</h2>
<p>With a quick but harmless swipe, you can aid an ally's assault.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 13, <a href="../feats.html#_combat-expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, base attack bonus +6.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a swift action, you can attempt the aid another action, granting your ally either a +1 bonus on his next attack roll or a +1 bonus to his AC.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Aid another is a standard action.</p>
<h2 id="taunt">Taunt</h2>
<p>You may be small, but your remarks cut others down to size.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 13, Small size or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can demoralize opponents using <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> rather than <a href="../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> (see the <a href="../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> skill description for details) and take no skill check penalty for being smaller than your target.</p>
<h2 id="team-up-combat">Team Up (Combat)</h2>
<p>When you are ganging up against an enemy, you can aid an ally with a quick feint.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 13, <a href="../feats.html#_combat-expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="#gang-up">Gang Up</a>, base attack bonus +6.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you and at least two of your allies are adjacent to an opponent, you can attempt the aid another action as a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Aid another is a standard action.</p>
<h2 id="teleport-tactician-combat">Teleport Tactician (Combat)</h2>
<p>You are highly alert for enemies using teleportation to approach you or flee from you.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_combat-reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_disruptive">Disruptive</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_spellbreaker">Spellbreaker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any creature using a teleportation effect to enter or leave a square threatened by you provokes an attack of opportunity, even if casting defensively or using a supernatural ability.</p>
<h2 id="tenacious-transmutation">Tenacious Transmutation</h2>
<p>Your mastery of the magic of changing makes your transmutations more durable.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_spell-focus">Spell Focus</a> (transmutation).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The DC of caster level checks to dispel or remove your transmutations increases by 2; even if the spell is negated, its effects persist for 1 additional round before dissipating.</p>
<h2 id="thundering-spell-metamagic">Thundering Spell (Metamagic)</h2>
<p>You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A thundering spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
<p>Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.</p>
<h2 id="touch-of-serenity-combat">Touch of Serenity (Combat)</h2>
<p>With a single touch you can reduce the threat of even the most savage of foes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 18, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage and bestows no other effect or condition, but the target cannot cast spells or attack (including attacks of opportunity and attacks as immediate actions) for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Will saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier. You may attempt a touch of serenity once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> A monk of the lotus receives <a href="#touch-of-serenity">Touch of Serenity</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a touch of serenity a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.</p>
<h2 id="trick-riding-combat">Trick Riding (Combat)</h2>
<p>You are not only skilled at controlling a horse in combat; you can make it look like art.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> 9 ranks, <a href="../feats.html#_mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While wearing light or no armor, you do not need to make <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> skill checks for any task listed in the <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> skill with a DC of 15 or lower. You do not take a –5 penalty for riding a mount bareback. You can make a check using <a href="../feats.html#_mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</a> to negate a hit on your mount twice per round instead of just once.</p>
<h2 id="tripping-strike-combat">Tripping Strike (Combat)</h2>
<p>The force intrinsic to your critical hits can knock your foes down.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 13, <a href="../feats.html#_combat-expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-trip">Improved Trip</a>, base attack bonus +9.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can trip your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may knock your opponent prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop your weapon to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> You must perform a trip combat maneuver to trip an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: <a href="#bull-rush-strike">Bull Rush Strike</a>, <a href="#disarming-strike">Disarming Strike</a>, <a href="#repositioning-strike">Repositioning Strike</a>, <a href="#sundering-strike">Sundering Strike</a>, or <a href="#tripping-strike">Tripping Strike</a>. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.</p>
<h2 id="under-and-over-combat">Under and Over (Combat)</h2>
<p>You can slip under a foe trying to grab you, knocking him off balance.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_agile-maneuvers">Agile Maneuvers</a>, Small size or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If an opponent larger than you attempts to grapple you and fails, you may make a trip attack as an immediate action against that opponent with a +2 bonus. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="underfoot-combat">Underfoot (Combat)</h2>
<p>You slip under and around your larger foes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../feats.html#_dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="../feats.html#_mobility">Mobility</a>, Small size or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You receive a +4 dodge bonus on <a href="../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks to move past opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity, so long as they are larger than you. In addition, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by <a href="../feats.html#_mobility">Mobility</a>, for a total bonus of +6).</p>
<h2 id="vermin-heart">Vermin Heart</h2>
<p>You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter, and sting.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wild empathy class feature.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may target vermin with spells and special abilities that only affect animals (although they are still affected by spells targeting vermin as well). You may use wild empathy to influence vermin as easily as you influence animals.</p>
<h2 id="war-singer">War Singer</h2>
<p>Your songs draw upon the savage chants and brutal ways of your people, inspiring those around you to new heights of violence and savagery.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 13, bardic performance class feature, half-orc or orc.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use bardic performance with audible components on a battlefield (any area where a combat involving a dozen or more combatants is taking place), the range or area of your chosen performance is doubled. In addition, the DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2 for creatures of the orc subtype, regardless of where the performance occurs.</p>
<h2 id="well-prepared">Well-Prepared</h2>
<p>Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies close at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Halfling.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a <a href="../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to “happen” to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry—if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and “acquire” new items. You must pay for these items normally.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> At the GM's option, a character can substitute the <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> skill for <a href="../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.</p>
<h1 id="equipment">Equipment</h1>
<p>A well-equipped character can take on nearly any challenge, from surviving in the wilderness to making an impression at the king's banquet. This chapter presents all manner of mundane and exotic equipment for the PCs to purchase and use, from weapons to armor, alchemical items to masterwork tools, fine wines to trail rations. The equipment presented here should be relatively easy to find and purchase in most towns and cities, although GMs might wish to restrict the availability of some of the more expensive and exotic items.</p>
<h1 id="weapons">Weapons</h1>
<p>Adventurers are always on the look out for new or strange weapons to give them an advantage in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow, Blunt</strong>: These arrows have rounded wooden tips. They deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing damage. An archer can use a blunt arrow to deal nonlethal damage (at the normal –4 attack penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage).</p>
<p><strong>Arrow, Flight</strong>: These arrows have light shafts and special fletchings to give them greater range. A flight arrow's range increment is 20 feet greater with longbows, 10 feet greater with shortbows. They deal damage as if one size category smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow, Smoke</strong>: This arrow is actually a specially-shaped smokestick that can be fired from a bow. It trails smoke as it flies, and creates a 5-foot cube of smoke where it strikes. It otherwise functions like a normal arrow in terms of damage, range, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Bardiche</strong>: The crescent axe-blade of this polearm is attached to the haft at two points: the center of the blade attaches to a socket at the top of the haft, and the lower point of the blade attaches to a secondary mount point. The blade is often very long, sometimes almost as long as the haft. You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD to resist sunder attempts against a bardiche.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Aspergillum</strong>: Named for the common aspergillum, a mace-like tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug to fit the hollow's neck. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, otherwise the holy water leaks out as the weapon moves.</p>
<p><strong>Bayonet</strong>: Bayonets are close combat weapons designed to fit into the grooves or muzzles of crossbows and firearms. They allow you to make melee attacks with these weapons but render them temporarily useless as ranged weapons. Attaching or removing a bayonet is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Bec de Corbin</strong>: The bec de corbin is a polearm very similar to the lucerne hammer, but the hammer head is blunt rather than spiked and the spike is stouter and more hooked. You primarily attack with the spike. You gain a +2 bonus to your CMB to sunder medium or heavy armor with a bec de corbin.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: The blade of this polearm is a curved or hooked chopping blade with a spiked projection on the back of the blade. The spike is commonly used to block and parry. When fighting defensively or with full defense, this weapon gives you a +1 shield bonus to AC. A mounted opponent hit by a bill takes a –1 penalty on his <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> check to stay mounted.</p>
<p><strong>Boar Spear</strong>: This spear with a spiraling blade has a metal crossbar approximately halfway down its length. If you ready a boar spear against a charge and your attack hits, you get a +2 shield bonus to your AC against that creature until your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Boomerang</strong>: The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is made of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve, and a sharp backward bend at the head. A thrown boomerang does not fly in a returning path; returning boomerangs are solely recreational.</p>
<p><strong>Brass Knuckles</strong>: These close combat weapons are designed to fit comfortably around the knuckles, narrowing the contact area and therefore magnifying the amount of force delivered by a punch. They allow you to deal lethal damage with unarmed attacks. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a spell with a somatic component while wearing brass knuckles if you make a concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you're casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles and can use their monk unarmed damage when fighting with them.</p>
<p><strong>Cestus</strong>: The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal normal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, your unarmed strikes may deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a –2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand (such as opening locks).</p>
<p><strong>Chain Spear</strong>: This vicious weapon often finds its way into gladiatorial events due to its versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>Chakram</strong>: The chakram is a simple, elegant, and highly portable thrown weapon. It is a flat, open-centered metal discus with a sharpened edge. You can wield the chakram as a melee weapon, but it is not designed for such use; you take a –1 penalty on your attack roll with the weapon and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or cut yourself on the blade (half damage, no Strength modifier). You do not need to make this save if wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Double Crossbow</strong>: This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Due to its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or –8 if you're not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage only apply to the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the <a href="../feats.html#_rapid-reload">Rapid Reload</a> feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery allows you to reload both bolts as a move action</p>
<p><strong>Falcata</strong>: This heavy blade has a single sharp, concave edge and a hook-shaped hilt. Its shape distributes the weight to give it the momentum of an axe with the cutting edge of a sword.</p>
<p><strong>Glaive-Guisarme</strong>: This polearm combines the blade of a glaive with a wicked hook. A mounted opponent hit by a glaive-guisarme takes a –2 penalty on his <a href="../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> check to stay mounted.</p>
<p><strong>Khopesh</strong>: This heavy blade has a convex curve near the end, making its overall shape similar to a battleaxe.</p>
<p><strong>Lasso</strong>: This thrown weapon is a length of rope with a simple open knot on one end that allows you entangle a foe like you would using a net. The DC to cast a spell while entangled with a lasso is 10 + the spell level being cast. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 15 <a href="../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hit points and AC 10. It requires a DC 23 Strength check to break it. On a successful hit, the lasso tightens; to use it again you must spend a standard action sliding the knot to enlarge the loop.</p>
<p><strong>Lucerne Hammer</strong>: This polearm has both a pronged hammer head for crushing blows and a spiked head for piercing and peeling armor; most attacks are made with the hammer. The long haft allows the wielder to put amazing force behind the head of this weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to your CMB to sunder medium or heavy armor with a lucerne hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Mancatcher</strong>: This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is built to capture a creature of a particular size category (such as Small or Medium) and doesn't work on creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch attack to hit an opponent and a combat maneuver check to grapple him (without the –4 penalty for not having two hands free); success means you and the target are grappled. Once the target is grappled, you can perform a move or damage grapple action against him. The mancatcher has hardness 10 and 5 hit points; it requires a DC 26 Strength check to break it. If you drop the mancatcher, the target can free himself as a standard action.</p>
<p><strong>Pilum</strong>: The tip of this heavy javelin is designed to break off and embed itself into a shield once it hits. Like ammunition, a thrown pilum that hits its target is destroyed. If you hit a shield-using opponent with a pilum, he loses the AC bonuses from that shield until he takes a standard action to pry the remnants of the pilum from his shield.</p>
<p><strong>Sword Cane</strong>: This slender light blade lies within a wooden container that serves as both its scabbard and hiding place. You can draw the blade from the cane as a swift action (or a free action if you have the <a href="../feats.html#_quick-draw">Quick Draw</a> feat). An observer must make a DC 20 <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check to realize an undrawn sword cane is a weapon rather than a walking stick; the DC decreases to 10 if the observer is able to handle the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Swordbreaker Dagger</strong>: You can use this dagger to disarm or sunder enemy blades by catching them in the grooves on the back of the blade and using your weapon as a lever. If you are proficient with this weapon, add +4 on your disarm or sunder attempts against bladed weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Temple Sword</strong>: Heavy blades typically used by guardians of religious sites, temple swords have distinctive crescent-shaped blades, appearing as an amalgam of a sickle and sword. Many have holes drilled into the blade or places on the pommel where charms, bells, or other holy trinkets might be attached. Monks are proficient with the temple sword.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Stake</strong>: This close combat weapon is just a sharpened piece of wood. Iron spikes used as weapons deal damage as wooden stakes.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Weight figures are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much, and a Large weapon weighs twice as much.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> A weapon with two types is both types if the entry specifies “and,” or either type (wielder's choice) if the entry specifies “or.”</p>
<h1 id="armor">Armor</h1>
<p>These armors follow the same rules as the armors presented in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Agile Breastplate</strong>: This breastplate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for <a href="../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> checks and jump checks is only –1 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty).</p>
<p><strong>Agile Half-Plate</strong>: This style of half-plate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for <a href="../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> checks and jump checks is only –4 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). In addition, unlike most heavy armors, the wearer can still run at quadruple speed instead of triple speed.</p>
<p><strong>Armored Coat</strong>: This sturdy leather coat is reinforced with metal plates sewn into the lining. More cumbersome than light armor but less effective than most medium armors, the advantage of an armored coat is that a person can don it or remove it as a move action (there is no “don hastily” option for an armored coat). If worn over other armor, use the better AC bonus and worse value in all other categories; an armored coat has no effect if worn with heavy armor. The only magic effects that apply are those worn on top.</p>
<p><strong>Quickdraw Shield, Light Wooden or Steel</strong>: This light shield is specially crafted with a series of straps to allow a character proficient in shields to ready or stow it on his or her back quickly and easily. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a swift action combined with a regular move. If you have the <a href="../feats.html#_two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat, you can draw a light or one-handed weapon with one hand and a quickdraw shield with the other in the time it would normally take you to draw one weapon. If you have the <a href="../feats.html#_quick-draw">Quick Draw</a> feat, you may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Quilted Cloth</strong>: This enhanced form of padded armor has internal layers specifically designed to trap arrows, bolts, darts, shuriken, thrown daggers, and other small ranged piercing weapons. When these kinds of weapons strike you, they tend to become snagged in these layers and fail to harm you. You gain DR 3/— against attacks of this kind. The special layers of the armor have no effect on other kinds of weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Armor</strong>: This suit of leather armor has plates of fire-treated wood sewn over vital areas. Though not as effective as metal armor, it offers better protection than leather alone. Unlike metal armor, the wood is slightly buoyant, and the armor check penalty for swimming in this armor is 0.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> These items weigh one-quarter this amount when made for Small characters. Containers for Small characters also carry one-quarter the normal amount.</p>
<p>Adventurers are always looking for equipment that gives them an advantage—their very survival depends on it.</p>
<h1 id="adventuring-gear">Adventuring Gear</h1>
<p>The following special gear supplements that listed in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Backpack, Masterwork</strong>: This backpack has numerous pockets for storing various items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Barbed Vest:</strong> Thin leather flaps keep the hundreds of tiny, fishhook-like needles dotting the surface of this black vest from harming you while you wear it. However, any creature that injures you with a natural or unarmed attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage. If a creature swallows you it takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits you up, you escape, or you die (at which point the vest has sustained enough damage to no longer serve as a threat). The vest can only be worn over light armor or no armor.</p>
<p><strong>Blanket</strong>: This warm, woven blanket has straps so it can be rolled up and tied.</p>
<p><strong>Buoy, Common</strong>: A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in lakes, rivers, or similar bodies of water making it possible for you to return to that location a later date. Each includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them.</p>
<p><strong>Buoy, Superior</strong>: This buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float typically copper, a length of chain rather than twine, and a metal anchor rather than a weight. It is otherwise the same as a common buoy.</p>
<p><strong>Butterfly Net:</strong> One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects out from material capable of passing through the net such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Chalkboard:</strong> A wooden frame approximately the same size as a large book surrounds this thinly sliced piece of polished black stone. Rubbing a simple damp cloth over the slate erases anything scribed with chalk on its surface.</p>
<p><strong>Chest</strong>: The common wooden chest comes in several sizes, including small (2 cubic feet, 1 hit point, Break DC 17), medium (4 cubic feet, 15 hp, Break DC 23), large (6 cubic feet, 30 hit points, Break DC 29), and huge (8 cubic feet, 50 hit points, Break DC 35). Most include a simple inset lock.</p>
<p><strong>Earplugs</strong>: Made of waxed cotton or cork, earplugs give you a +2 circumstance bonus on saves against effects that require hearing but also cause a –5 penalty on hearing-based <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Hourglass</strong>: The standard hourglass takes 1 hour to empty the sand from the upper chamber; larger and smaller timers exist which mark off time in increments as short as 6 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Spike</strong>: This foot-long iron spike is used to keep doors open or closed and to secure ropes for climbing. Hearing a spike being hammered in requires a DC 5 <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check.</p>
<p><strong>Magnet</strong>: Handheld magnets are relatively weak and are mainly used to detect or pull iron, mithral, or adamantine at a short range. This hand-sized horseshoe magnet can lift up to a 3-pound iron weight.</p>
<p><strong>Marbles</strong>: Like caltrops, marbles can be used to slow down opponents. One 2-pound bag of marbles covers an area 5 feet square. A creature entering a square with marbles scattered on it must make a DC 10 Reflex save or fall prone (the creature's stability bonus to trip applies to this save). Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a square of marbles with no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Paper</strong>: Ordinary paper typically measures 9 inches by 6 inches and is unsuitable for making magical scrolls. It has hardness 0, 1 hit point, and break DC 5.</p>
<p><strong>Periscope:</strong> This 2-foot-long metal tube has right angles at each end with mirrors inside; if you look in one end, you can see out the other end, allowing you safely peer over obstacles, around corners, or into small spaces your head wouldn't fit. When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object, making it much less likely an observed creature notices you; if you have total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the tube's Diminutive size modifier for your <a href="../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a> instead of your own size modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a –4 penalty on <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and any damage that gets through the tube's hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>Poison Pill Ring</strong>: This ring has a tiny compartment under the setting, typically used to hold poison. Opening and closing a ring is a move action; doing so unseen requires a DC 20 <a href="../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check.</p>
<p><strong>Powder</strong>: Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with adventurers for their utility in pinpointing invisible creatures. Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals if there is an invisible creature there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Rice Paper</strong>: This variety of paper is made of rice or tree bark. It has hardness 0, 1 hit point, and break DC 2.</p>
<p><strong>Rope, Spider's Silk</strong>: Rare to virtually nonexistent on the surface world, spider's silk rope is woven of strands of silk from monstrous spiders by goblin slaves in the employ of the drow. As such it is commonly used by the dark elves, though shorter spider's silk rope scraps (generally no more than 10 feet long) frequently appear among goblins. Spider's silk rope has 6 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong>Scroll Case</strong>: A leather or wooden scroll case easily holds four scrolls; you can cram more inside but retrieving any of them becomes a full-round action rather than a move action. You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (hardness 2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 hit points, Break DC 15). A scroll case is not water-tight.</p>
<p><strong>Signal Horn</strong>: Sounding a horn requires a DC 10 <a href="../skills/perform.html#_perform">Perform</a> (wind instruments) check and can convey concepts such as “Attack!”, “Help!”, “Advance!”, “Retreat!”, “Fire!”, and, “Alarm!” The report of a signal horn can be clearly heard (<a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> DC 0) up to a half-mile distant. For each quarter-mile beyond, <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks to hear the horn suffer a –1 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Smoked Goggles</strong>: These spectacles have lenses made of smoked glass that help protect against creatures with gaze attacks. You are always treated as averting your gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and you gain a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against visual-based attacks (any attack that a blind creature would be immune to). You have a –4 penalty on <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks while wearing the goggles, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).</p>
<p><strong>String or Twine</strong>: Sold in balls or spools of 50 feet, string and twine are useful for rigging traps and alarms and are a vital component of grappling bolts and arrows. String or twine has hardness 0, 1 hit point, and Break DC 14.</p>
<p><strong>Swarmsuit:</strong> These heavy and overlapping layers of clothing, coupled with a wide hat outfitted with a dense, veil-like netting around its brim makes it all but impossible for Diminutive and Fine creatures to make physical contact with your body. Wearing a swarmsuit cuts your speed in half, but gives you DR 10/— against swarms of Fine creatures and DR 5/— against swarms of Diminutive creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Tattoo</strong>: The cost of a tattoo depends on the quality, size, and number of colors used. A coin-sized tattoo in blue ink that will blur over a decade may cost 1 cp, a hand-sized one in black ink that won't fade costs 1 sp, and a tattoo covering an entire back takes several sessions and costs 10 gp. Each additional color costs as much as a single tattoo of its size.</p>
<p><strong>Tent</strong>: Tents come in a variety of sizes and accommodate between one and 10 people. A small tent holds one Medium creature and takes 20 minutes to assemble, a medium tent holds two creatures and takes 30 minutes, a large tent holds four creatures and takes 45 minutes, and a pavilion holds 10 creatures and takes 90 minutes (two Small creatures count as a Medium creature, and one Large creature counts as two Medium creatures). Pavilion tents are large enough to accommodate a small fire in the center. Packing up a tent takes half as long as assembling it.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Cord</strong>: Weapon cords are 2-foot-long leather straps that attach your weapon to your wrist. If you drop your weapon or are disarmed, you can recover it as a swift action, and it never moves any further away from you than an adjacent square. However, you cannot switch to a different weapon without first untying the cord (a full-round action) or cutting it (a move action or an attack, hardness 0, 0 hp). Unlike a locked gauntlet, you can still use a hand with a weapon cord, though a dangling weapon may interfere with finer actions.</p>
<p><strong>Whistle, Signal</strong>: With a DC 5 <a href="../skills/perform.html#_perform">Perform</a> (wind instruments) check you can use a whistle to signal the same sorts of situations as signal horns. A whistle's piercing report can be clearly heard (<a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> DC 0) up to a quarter-mile away. For each quarter-mile beyond, <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks to hear a whistle suffer a –2 penalty.</p>
<p>Silent whistles that only animals and other creatures with keen hearing can hear also exist.</p>
<h1 id="special-substances-and-items">Special Substances and Items</h1>
<p>Any of these substances can be made by a character with the <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) skill.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemical Grease</strong>: Each pot of this slick black goo has sufficient contents to cover one Medium or two Small creatures. If you coat yourself in alchemical grease, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on <a href="../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> checks, on combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to your CMD to avoid being grappled; this lasts 4 hours or until you wash it off.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemical Solvent</strong>: This bubbling purple gel eats through adhesives. Each vial can cover a single 5-foot square. It destroys normal adhesives (such as tar, tree sap, or glue) in a single round but takes 1d4+1 rounds to deal with more powerful adhesives (tanglefoot bags, spider webbing, and so on). It has no affect on fully magical adhesives, including <em><a href="../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_sovereign-glue">sovereign glue</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist's Kindness</strong>: Favored by young rakes and others of means, this is a crystalline powder resembling salt. Mixed with water, it makes a fizzing cocktail that eliminates the effects of a hangover within 10 minutes of drinking it.</p>
<p><strong>Alkali Flask</strong>: This flask of caustic liquid reacts with an ooze's natural acids. You can throw an alkali flask as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Against non-ooze creatures, an alkali flask functions as a normal flask of acid. Against oozes and other acid-based creatures, the alkali flask inflicts double damage.</p>
<p><strong>Antiplague</strong>: If you drink a vial of this foul-tasting, milky tonic, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease for the next hour. If already infected, you may also make two saving throws (without the +5 bonus) that day and use the better result.</p>
<p><strong>Bladeguard</strong>: This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks from oozes, rust monsters, and similar effects that corrode or melt weapons, rendering the weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can coat one two-handed weapon, two one-handed or light weapons, or 50 ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full round. Immersing the weapon in water or similar liquid washes it off.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodblock</strong>: This gooey, pinkish substance helps treat wounds. Using a dose gives you a +5 alchemical bonus on <a href="../skills/heal.html#_heal">Heal</a> checks for providing first aid, treating wounds made by caltrops or similar objects, or treating deadly wounds. A dose of bloodblock ends a bleed effect as if you had made a DC 15 <a href="../skills/heal.html#_heal">Heal</a> check. When treating deadly wounds, using a dose of bloodblock counts as one use of a healer's kit (and grants the +5 bonus stated above).</p>
<p><strong>Casting Plaster</strong>: This white, dry powder mixes with water to form a paste, which hardens over the course of an hour to create a solid material. It can be used to make casts of footprints or carvings, fill in gaps or cracks in walls, or (if applied over a cloth wrapping) create a splint for a broken bone. Hardened plaster has hardness 1 and 5 hp per inch of thickness. A 5-pound clay pot of plaster can cover about five square feet of flat space to a depth of one inch, five Medium forearm or lower-leg casts, or two full-arm or full-leg casts.</p>
<p><strong>Flash Powder</strong>: This coarse gray powder ignites and burns almost instantly if exposed to flame, significant friction, or even a simple force such as throwing it against a floor (a standard action). Creatures within the 10-foot-radius burst are blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 13 negates).</p>
<p><strong>Light Detector</strong>: This hand-sized metal plate is covered with a thin layer of light-sensitive transparent paste. If exposed to light, the paste darkens and becomes opaque, depending on the amount of light. Bright light causes it to fully darken in 1 round, normal light in 3 rounds, dim light in 10 rounds. It is mainly used by creatures with darkvision to determine if creatures have recently passed through an area carrying light. The plate is sold wrapped in a thick black cloth to prevent accidental light exposure from ruining the plate.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid Ice</strong>: Also known as “alchemist's ice,” this sealed jar of crystalline blue fluid immediately starts to evaporate once opened. During the next 1d6 rounds, you can use it to freeze a liquid or to coat an object in a thin layer of ice. You can also throw liquid ice as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of cold damage; creatures within 5 feet of where it hits take 1 point of cold damage from the splash.</p>
<p><strong>Nushadir</strong>: Normally stored in the form of small, salty pellets in a dry container, this reagent can be mixed with a flask of water and stored safely. Nushadir neutralizes acid; a vial of pellets or a flask of nushadir-water is enough to render a cubic foot of acid safe to touch in 1 minute, though this is usually too slow to prevent damage from a thrown vial of acid or the contents of a large monster's gullet. Nushadir vapors are slightly irritating to the eyes, nose, and mouth, causing nausea for 1d4 rounds after close exposure (Fortitude DC 10 negates).</p>
<p><strong>Smelling Salts</strong>: These sharply scented gray crystals cause people inhaling them to regain consciousness. Smelling salts grant you a new saving throw to resist any spell or effect that has already rendered you unconscious or staggered. If exposed to smelling salts while dying, you immediately become conscious and staggered, but must still make stabilization checks each round; if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous action) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act and fall unconscious again. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left opened.</p>
<p><strong>Smoke Pellet</strong>: This small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier. When you break the sphere, the substances mingle and fill a 5-foot square with a cloud of foul but harmless yellow smoke. The smoke pellet acts as a smokestick, except the smoke only lasts for 1 round before dispersing. You may throw a smoke pellet as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Sneezing Powder</strong>: This coarse yellowish-red powder is a splash weapon that causes uncontrollable sneezing for 1d4+1 rounds. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the powder, while those in adjacent squares must make DC 8 Fortitude saves. Creatures affected by sneezing powder must make a DC 10 Fortitude save every round for the duration or be staggered until their next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Soothe Syrup</strong>: This sweet and wholesome-tasting blue liquid creates a sense of warmth and comfort. Soothe syrup coats your stomach and makes it much more difficult for you to succumb to queasiness. For 1 hour after drinking soothe syrup you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on saving throws made to resist effects that would make you nauseated or sickened.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Blanch</strong>: These alchemical powders have a gritty consistency. When poured on a weapon and placed over a hot flame for a full round, they melt and form a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the ability to bypass one kind of material-based damage reduction, such as adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The blanching remains effective until the weapon makes a successful attack. Each dose of blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit.</p>
<h1 id="tools-and-skill-kits">Tools and Skill Kits</h1>
<p>These items are particularly useful to characters with certain skills and class abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Abacus</strong>: This device helps users perform mathematical calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist's Kit</strong>: An alchemist with an alchemist's kit is assumed to have all the material components needed for his extracts, mutagens, and bombs, except for those components that have a specific cost. An alchemist's kit provides no bonuses on <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist's Lab, Portable</strong>: This compact version of a full-sized alchemist's lab provides a +1 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Anvil</strong>: While anvil sizes vary depending on the type of smithing for which they are used, all anvils have the same basic shape and construction. Blacksmith anvils are typically much heavier and larger (100 pounds) than farrier anvils (50 pounds), and they in turn are much bigger than silver- or goldsmith anvils (10 pounds). Many metalworking tasks are impossible without the proper anvil.</p>
<p><strong>Astrolabe</strong>: This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the user; the upper disc represents the sky, and is filled with astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to use an astrolabe at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute). An astrolabe grants a +2 circumstance on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) and <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks to navigate in the wilderness (and on <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> [sailor] checks to navigate at sea).</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Pole</strong>: These flexible poles range from 15–30 feet in length and, when used properly, help you keep your balance when crossing narrow walkways. Using a balancing pole grants you a +1 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks made to traverse a narrow surface.</p>
<p><strong>Bear Trap</strong>: Although intended for trapping large animals, bear traps work as well for trapping humanoids or monsters. The hinged jaws of the trap are attached to a chain, which in turn is secured to a spike driven into the ground to ensure that the victim cannot simply crawl away. Prying open the jaws or pulling the spike from the ground requires a DC 20 Strength check.</p>

<p><strong>Bellows</strong>: Bellows are useful for starting fires, providing a +1 circumstance bonus on appropriate <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Cauldron</strong>: This iron pot may have a hook for hanging over a fire, but versions intended for traveling usually have three or four legs to let it stand over a fire. It holds approximately one gallon, and can be used for cooking, potion-making, and other similar activities.</p>
<p><strong>Compass</strong>: An ordinary compass that points to the magnetic north pole grants its user a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks made to avoid becoming lost. It also can be used to grant the same bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) checks made to navigate underground.</p>
<p><strong>Drill</strong>: A drill can create a 1-inch-diameter hole in stone, wood, or metal as a standard action. Harder materials wear down or break the drill more quickly. Hearing the sound of drilling requires a DC 15 <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check.</p>
<p><strong>Footprint Book:</strong> This 50-page tome contains accurate drawings of various common animal, humanoid, and monster tracks, as well as notes on stride length, tread depth, and similarly useful information. The book gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to identify a creature by its tracks, though the use of shoes makes identifying many humanoids difficult or impossible. Though the book can't help you identify unique individuals, it can help you tell an ogre footprint from a troll footprint, or an elf's track from an orc's. Books sold in different areas may have different footprints, depending on what creatures are common to that location.</p>
<p><strong>Fortune-Teller's Deck</strong>: This deck of illustrated cards is used by those in tune with the spirit world to predict the future—and by charlatans to take money from gullible or desperate people. A common deck only has simple drawings on parchment scraps or simple wooden plaques. A quality fortune-teller's deck is usually of quality wooden plaques with painted color images; it is suitable as a focus for the <em><a href="../spells/augury.html#_augury">augury</a></em> spell, and provides a +1 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> (fortune-teller), <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> (medium), and similar <a href="../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> checks. A masterwork fortune-teller's deck may be wood, ivory, or even metal, with painted or carved images and often highlighted with gold inlays or tiny gems; it has all the benefits of a quality deck, except it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the listed skill checks.</p>
<p><strong>Leeching Kit</strong>: This sturdy ceramic jar has a heavy lid with a few tiny holes to let air in. It is normally half-filled with water and contains four adult leeches, each about 6 inches long. A leeching kit grants a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/heal.html#_heal">Heal</a> checks to treat poison. Used for medicinal bloodletting, a leech can survive for 6 months between feedings.</p>
<p><strong>Map Maker's Kit</strong>: This small kit contains a simple slate with a grid carved into its surface and a number of different colored pieces of chalk. Anyone using this kit to draw a map as they travel receives a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> skill checks to avoid becoming lost.</p>
<p><strong>Portrait Book</strong>: This 100-page book contains face drawings of male and female dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans. By selecting an appropriate drawing and adding hair, beard, or other small features such as moles or scars, even a poor artist can quickly create a reasonable likeness of a specific person—for example, an inquisitor making wanted posters of a half-elven witch.</p>
<p><strong>Pulley</strong>: A simple block-and-tackle pulley, when properly secured, adds a +5 circumstance bonus on Strength checks to lift heavy objects. Securing the pulley requires 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Saw</strong>: You can insert a saw between a door and its frame to cut through wooden bolts or bars, dealing 5 hit points per round plus your Strength modifier to the sawed object as a full-round action. Hearing the sawing requires a DC 10 <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check. Saws used to cut ice on rivers have a point on the end to break through the ice before cutting.</p>
<p><strong>Sextant</strong>: A sextant is used to determine your latitude. A sextant grants a +4 circumstance bonus on <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks made to navigate while above ground.</p>
<p><strong>Symptom Kit:</strong> This small wooden box has many tiny compartments filled with items useful if you want to feign a sickness as well as a handy reference book outlining common indicators for some of the more feared virulent diseases. The kit includes such things as false pustules, pills that cause the person chewing them to foam at the mouth, and herbal concoctions designed to induce fevers or vomiting. Using a symptom kit grants you a +5 circumstances bonus on <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise">Disguise</a> checks made for the purpose of simulating illness. A symptom kit is exhausted after 10 uses.</p>
<p><strong>Traveling Spellbook</strong>: A traveling spellbook is lighter and less cumbersome than its full-size counterpart. It has 50 pages.</p>
<h1 id="clothing">Clothing</h1>
<p>The following items may supplement other outfits.</p>
<p><strong>Cleats</strong>: Useful on any terrain where traction may be a concern, cleats are shoes with spikes or hooks attached to the soles. Cleats reduce the penalty for walking over slick surfaces by 50%; for example, walking across ice normally costs 2 squares for every square of movement, but with cleats it costs only 1.5 squares for every square. Cleats cause damage to any type of finished flooring.</p>
<p><strong>Furs</strong>: The most basic of cold-weather gear, animal furs serve to keep their wearers warm. Wearing enough fur to cover the body provides a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> skill.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Weather Outfit</strong>: Covering your body from head to foot in light, airy cloth keeps you cooler than baring your skin to the sun. This outfit typically consists of a loose linen robe and either a turban or loose head covering and veil. The outfit provides a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist warm or hot weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> skill.</p>
<p><strong>Snowshoes</strong>: These high-tension nets of rope or sinew in wooden frames which are lashed to the feet spread your weight across the snow, making you much less likely to break through the crust and rendering walking much easier. Snowshoes reduce the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for example, if moving through snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square traveled.</p>
<h1 id="animal-related-gear">Animal-Related Gear</h1>
<p>The following animal-related items can be found in most cities.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Harness</strong>: This leather or hemp harness allows a holder to restrain and control a domesticated animal. Ready-made harnesses are available in most markets for common domesticated animals such as cats, dogs, horses, and oxen, but harnesses can be made for nearly any creature.</p>
<p><strong>Cage</strong>: This secure, portable enclosure is used to hold creatures—generally animals, but a large enough cage can hold anything. Cages are made from iron, wood, or bamboo, depending on local customs and available materials.</p>
<p><strong>Dog Sled</strong>: This sled is several feet long and is designed to be pulled over snow and ice by a team of trained riding dogs. Most sleds have runners at the back for a musher to stand on. A dog sled can carry up to the carrying capacity of all the dogs that pull it.</p>
<h1 id="entertainment-items">Entertainment Items</h1>
<p>Means of cheating at games always seem to be of interest to some adventurers.</p>
<p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Most loaded dice are weighted—a heavier substance is included opposite the desired number. You can spot marks from tampering with a die in this fashion with a DC 15 <a href="../skills/appraise.html#_appraise">Appraise</a> or <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check. Higher-quality dice (such as wooden dice carved around a naturally heavy inclusion) have DCs ranging from 20 to 30.</p>
<p><strong>Marked Cards</strong>: Whether bent, colored, or scratched, marked cards allow an informed user to know what's on the front of the card by viewing the mark on the back. Realizing that the cards are marked requires a DC 25 <a href="../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check.</p>
<h1 id="spells">Spells</h1>
<p>Beyond the spells presented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> exist countless more mystical discoveries and the secret tricks of spellcasters arcane and divine. The following lists summarize all of the new spells presented in this book, broken down by class. Note that, with the exception of the antipaladin's full spell list, the lists here summarize only new spells from this book. An <strong>M</strong> or <strong>F</strong>appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists denotes a <em>material</em> or <em>focus</em> component, respectively, not normally included in a spell component pouch.</p>
<p><strong>Full Spell Lists</strong>^^: The full lists of available spells for the spellcasting base classes introduced in this book appear in Chapter Two at the end of each spellcasting class's entry. Note that oracles use the same spell list as clerics.</p>
<p><strong>Order of Presentation</strong>^^: In the spell lists and the short descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell's name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>^^: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level</strong>^^: A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. The word “level” in the short descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.</p>
<p><strong>Creatures and Characters</strong>^^: “Creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the short description.</p>

<h1 id="spells-2">Spells</h1>
<h2 id="absorbing-touch">Absorbing Touch</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> object touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You absorb the next object your hand touches into your body. If you are already holding an object, you can attempt to absorb it; otherwise, you may touch an object as a standard action separate from casting the spell. You can absorb any nonmagical, nonliving object weighing no more than 1 pound per caster level. A container and its contents count as a single object. Objects in the possession of another creature receive a Fortitude saving throw to prevent absorption. You may continue to attempt to absorb objects until one is absorbed.</p>
<p>An absorbed object melds with your hand and cannot be targeted, but the object's weight still counts against your carrying capacity. If you dismiss the spell, the item appears in the hand that absorbed it, or falls to the ground if that hand is full. Multiple castings let you absorb additional items, but you can only store a single item per hand.</p>

<p>You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally has an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no onset time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and inflicting damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is halved. <em><a href="#accelerate-poison">Accelerate poison</a></em> does not change the cure condition for the poison. If the target is affected by more than one poison, you may choose which is affected if you administered the poison; otherwise, randomly determine which poison is affected.</p>
<h2 id="acid-pit">Acid Pit</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [acid]; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (drop of acid), F (Fine shovel worth 10 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell functions as <em><a href="createPit.html#_create-pit-">create pit</a></em>, except that it places a 5-foot-deep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 216). Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> DC of 30.</p>
<h2 id="alchemical-allocation">Alchemical Allocation</h2>

<p><strong>Components</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>This extract causes a pale aura to emanate from your mouth. If you consume a potion or elixir on the round following the consumption of this extract, you can spit it back into its container as a free action. You gain all the benefits of the potion or elixir, but it is not consumed. You can only gain the benefits of one potion or elixir in this way per use of this extract.</p>
<h2 id="allfood">Allfood</h2>

<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> object touched, weighing up to 5 lbs./level</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (object)</p>
<p>You can transform one object, weighing up to 5 lbs. per caster level, into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This <em><a href="#allfood-">allfood</a></em> always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency when chewed regardless of its original nature. One pound of <em><a href="#allfood-">allfood</a></em> provides enough sustenance to support a Medium creature for an entire day.</p>
<p>Objects of similar nature in close proximity, such as a pile of rocks, count as a single object for the purpose of this spell. You cannot use this spell to transform objects with magical or other exceptional qualities. An object's hardness is considered to be 0 for the purposes of eating it, but it retains its normal hardness for all other situations, and becomes no more vulnerable to sunder attacks, break attempts, or any other action typically directed against objects. Objects such as hot coals or a burning torch continue to produce energy even after you transform them into <em><a href="#allfood-">allfood</a></em> and if a creature attempts to eat such an object, it takes damage accordingly.</p>

<p>You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the spell's area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by you as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical) wind effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 439). The maximum wind force you can affect with this spell is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. <em><a href="#alter-winds">Alter winds</a></em> has no effect on magical wind effects.</p>

<p>The target's <a href="../../additionalRules.html#_carrying-capacity">carrying capacity</a> triples. This does not affect the creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it can carry while benefiting from this spell. It also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor.

<p>Any creature in the path of the <em><a href="#aqueous-orb">aqueous orb</a></em> takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a large or smaller creature that fails its save must make a second save or be engulfed by the <em><a href="#aqueous-orb">aqueous orb</a></em> and carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing water.

The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it.</p>
<p>The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and churns in place. An <em><a href="#aqueous-orb">aqueous orb</a></em> stops if it moves outside the spell's range.</p>

This bleed damage for each attack is equal to one-half your caster level (limited to the creature's maximum damage with that attack), though bleed damage does not stack.

<p>A <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em> is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em> lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em> to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em> were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a> uses</em> your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses. A <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em>'s attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity. There must be ammunition available for the <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em> to use, and it expends ammunition as if used by you.</p>
<p>A <em><a href="#bow-spirit">bow spirit</a></em> occupies your space, and moves with you.

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You open a link between your mind and the subject's mind, giving advice and encouragement for as long as the spell is in effect.

<h2 id="bristle">Bristle</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 1</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its innate toughness away from its own defense and toward the amount of damage it deals with natural attacks. Each round, as a swift action at the start of its turn, the creature can choose to reduce some or all of its natural armor bonus to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage rolls for natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to natural armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum penalty/bonus of -5/+5 at 15th level. A creature cannot reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this spell. All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures make this decision without any need for conscious thought or reflection; even creatures with no Intelligence score can benefit from this spell, although they always opt for the maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any tactical advantage they might lose.</p>
<h2 id="burning-gaze">Burning Gaze</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [fire]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (eye of a mundane salamander)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.</p>
<p>As a standard action as long as this spell's effects persist, you may direct your <em><a href="#burning-gaze">burning gaze</a></em> against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from <em><a href="#burning-gaze">burning gaze</a></em>.</p>
<p>Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack—foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.</p>
<h2 id="burst-bonds">Burst Bonds</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 1</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one object or creature restraining you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude half (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You blast your restraints with divine wrath, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the target object (maximum 5d6), ignoring hardness of 10 or less. A Fortitude save halves the damage, although only magical restraints receive a saving throw.</p>
<p>You can also target a creature that is grappling or otherwise restraining you (such as by adhesive or the swallow whole ability) with the spell. You don't need to make a touch attack to use <em><a href="#burst-bonds">burst bonds</a></em> against a creature, and you can cast this spell without making a concentration check while grappled or pinned. The creature does not take damage as above. If you are grappled and your target fails its save, you may make an immediate attempt to break the grapple (but not reverse it) as a free action, with a +1 luck bonus to your CMB per caster level (maximum +5). If the target creature fails its save and you are restrained by an ability that originally allowed a saving throw, <em><a href="#burst-bonds">burst bonds</a></em> allows a new saving throw with a +1 luck bonus per two caster levels (maximum +5).</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. <em><a href="../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment">Break enchantment</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/restoration.html#_restoration">restoration</a></em>, or <em><a href="../../spells/stoneToFlesh.html#_stone-to-flesh">stone to flesh</a></em> can reverse the effects of <em><a href="#calcific-touch">calcific touch</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> one animal whose CR is equal or less than your caster level</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 hour/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>none</p>
<p>This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.</p>
<p>When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell. Its starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.</p>
<p>Once the spell's duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.</p>
<p>Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by <em>call animals</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 2 hours/level; see below (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You can create a barrier around a fire of at least campfire size that shelters everyone inside so long as the fire continues to burn. The barrier appears as a crackling sphere of light and fire that is clearly visible, providing as much illumination as a torch. The barrier bocks line of sight, granting creatures on either side of the barrier total concealment from creatures on the other side. Any object or creature passing through the barrier from outside takes 1d6 points of fire damage and is also outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch, for 1d6 minutes. Creatures outlined in this way are plainly visible regardless of the light conditions and do not benefit from any sort of concealment, magical or otherwise. The light is not bright enough to have any special effect on undead or creatures vulnerable to light. Creatures inside the barrier can leave without penalty, but if they try to return they suffer the same consequences as anyone else. If the fire source at the barrier's center is extinguished or moved, the spell ends.</p>

<p>You compel the target to beg for forgiveness. On a failed save, the target cowers with fear. On a successful save, it is shaken for 1 round. Each round on its turn, a cowering subject may attempt a new save to end the effect. A creature who worships the same god as you takes a -2</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any <em><a href="../../spells/magicJar.html#_magic-jar">magic jar</a></em> effect (including a ghost's malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> spell, except <em><a href="#cast-out">cast out</a></em> can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess.

<p>You challenge an evil creature to bring the fight to you, or suffer the consequences. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on all melee attacks against the subject of the spell.

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p>You fade into the background, and while you are not truly invisible, you are hard to pinpoint due to your translucent state.

<p><strong>Range</strong> long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> see text</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex partial, see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam them together against a single creature between them. The <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em> appear up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em> ignore concealment and cover, and if there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em>, the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target. A creature struck by the <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em> takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the target fails a Reflex saving throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in (see <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 415).</p>
<p>If the <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em> miss the target, the target still takes 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage from falling rocks and is knocked prone. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy the spaces where the <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em> appear or within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long) must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing). A creature can only take damage once from the <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em>, no matter how many times the <em><a href="#clashing-rocks">clashing rocks</a></em> pass over a target creature.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p>Positive energy infuses and cleanses your body. This spell cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) and ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting you: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition, <em><a href="#cleanse">cleanse</a></em> functions as <em><a href="../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment">break enchantment</a></em> upon a single additional effect of your choice that is affecting you and that can be legally affected by this effect.</p>
<p>If used by undead or other creatures healed by negative energy, the spell cleanses with negative energy rather than positive.</p>

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You are surrounded by a soporific aroma that causes living creatures that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 feet of you to fall asleep for 1 minute. Creatures must save each time they begin their turn or end their movement within the <em><a href="#cloak-of-dreams">cloak of dreams</a></em>, even if they have previously saved against the effect. Sleeping creatures are helpless but can be awakened with a standard action or after being wounded. Creatures with the scent special quality have a -4 penalty on their saves.</p>

<p>This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from the harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental heat due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered very hot conditions, while very hot is considered average temperature (see <a href="../../environment.html#_heat-dangers">heat dangers</a>). The <em><a href="#cloak-of-shade">cloak of shade</a></em> also reduces any penalties from sunlight by 1. The spell does not, however, eliminate the effects of direct sunlight on creatures vulnerable to sunlight. <em><a href="#cloak-of-shade">Cloak of shade</a></em> has no effect on environmental heat from sources other than the sun.</p>
<h2 id="cloak-of-winds">Cloak of Winds</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration [air]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 3, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. The subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or lesser strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged attack rolls against the subject take a -4 penalty. Tiny or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save to successfully touch or attack the subject in melee. Failure knocks the attacker prone and pushes it 5 feet away from the subject per level of the caster. This movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without affecting them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that blocks its movement.</p>
<h2 id="confess">Confess</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You ask the target creature a single question. On the subject's next action, it must answer truthfully in the same language as the question or take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) and be sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save negates the sickening effect and halves the damage. A creature that is unable to answer still takes damage.</p>
<h2 id="contagious-flame">Contagious Flame</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [fire]; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> three or more rays</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 3 rounds</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three rays, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.</p>
<p>Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from each creature who took damage from the spell in the previous round—these new rays attack as if you fired them, but their point of origin is the previous creature damaged. You can choose the new targets as a free action, all of whom must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of their new starting point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of three rounds—a creature can be struck more than once by this spell over the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray of fire that launches from itself.</p>
<h2 id="coordinated-effort">Coordinated Effort</h2>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>Choose a single teamwork feat that you possess. You forge a link with your allies, allowing them to gain the benefits of the chosen feat even if they do not have it themselves. You must be a part of the group qualifying for a given bonus for your allies to gain the benefits. For example, two of your allies flanking an orc would gain no benefit from your Outflank feat, but an ally flanking the orc with you would. Your allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for either of you to receive the listed bonus.</p>
<h2 id="corruption-resistance">Corruption Resistance</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects that inflict damage based on the target creature's alignment, such as <em><a href="../../spells/holySmite.html#_holy-smite">holy smite</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/orderSWrath.html#_order-s-wrath">order's wrath</a></em>, a paladin's smite evil attack, or an <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_unholy">unholy</a></em> weapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or law. The subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that specifically harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection increases to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.</p>
<p><em><a href="#corruption-resistance">Corruption resistance</a></em> protects against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities, not physical attacks. <em><a href="#corruption-resistance">Corruption resistance</a></em> only protects against damage. The subject can still suffer side effects from such attacks. When you use this spell to protect an alignment, it gains the descriptor of that alignment.</p>
<h2 id="cowards-lament">Coward's Lament</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You compel an opponent to face you in combat, or suffer for its cowardice. Each round that the target fails to attack you in melee, it receives a cumulative -1 penalty to its Armor Class, attack rolls, and saving throws (maximum penalty -5). Each round at the end of its turn, the target may attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the penalties from increasing for that round. All penalties reset to zero when the target attacks you in melee, but increase again if it stops attacking. If the target is prevented from attacking you by physical restraint, magic, or impassable terrain, the penalties do not increase. If you move away from the target, the spell ends.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round + 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of 10 feet per two caster levels (maximum 30 feet). You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.</p>
<p>Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit's coarse stone walls have a <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> DC of 25. When the duration of the spell ends, creatures within the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.</p>
<h2 id="create-treasure-map">Create Treasure Map</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination; <strong>Level</strong> bard 2, druid 3, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one dead creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You can take a piece from a dead creature's body and use it to create a map that reveals the locations of any valuables that creature knew about while still alive. You must cut this piece off yourself and the creature cannot have died more than 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell. You cannot cast this spell on a creature without a physical body, and the portion you remove must have a fairly level surface such as a piece of hide, carapace, or skin. The map you create is accurate to the best knowledge the creature had at the time of its death. It reveals the location of one source of treasure for every three caster levels you possess. Any inaccuracies or faulty information held by the creature are represented on the map as well. Similarly, the map cannot account for any changes that occur after the creature's death. You must choose the scale of the map when creating it, opting between nearby (e.g., one or two dungeon levels), local (e.g., a valley or community), or broad (e.g., a country or larger). The map reveals the locations of what the creature deemed most valuable within its area. Depending on the creature, the map might reveal a source of tasty food, suitable mates, or even your own treasure vault.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 day/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes</p>
<p>You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to <a href="../../environment.html#_starvation-and-thirst">dehydrate</a>. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of drinking can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the other normal effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions). <em><a href="#cup-of-dust">Cup of dust</a></em>can be removed with a <em><a href="../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment">break enchantment</a>, <a href="../../spells/limitedWish.html#_limited-wish">limited wish</a>, <a href="../../spells/miracle.html#_miracle">miracle</a>, <a href="../../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse">remove curse</a>,</em>or <em><a href="../../spells/wish.html#_wish">wish</a></em> spell, but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be healed by normal means.</p>

<p>You can animate a lantern and order it to follow you. The lantern floats at shoulder height and remains within 5 feet of you, no matter how fast you move. The lantern cannot support any additional weight. The lantern illuminates its normal area, even if it does not have any oil in it. For the purposes of spells or effects targeting it the lantern always acts as if in your possession even when not directly on your person. A<em><a href="#dancing-lantern-">dancing lantern</a></em> can be made permanent with a <em><a href="../../spells/permanency.html#_permanency">permanency</a></em> spell (CL 9th, 2,500 gp).</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you immediately end your performance, dealing 2d8 points of sonic damage to each target. In addition, each target takes 3d6 points of bleed damage for 1d6 rounds. A save negates the bleed damage but not the sonic damage.</p>
<h2 id="deafening-song-bolt">Deafening Song Bolt</h2>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>Three notes you sing or perform become tangible bolts of arcane energy that shriek across the battlefield.

The bolts may be fired at the same or different targets, but all must be fired simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p>You surround yourself in a whirling barrier of force that sends any attack that misses you hurling back toward its source. This applies to any melee or ranged attack directed against you so long as it uses an attack roll to determine whether or not it strikes you. If an attack misses you, the attacker must make a second attack roll against its own Armor Class, using all of the applicable modifiers of the original attack and if it hits, the attacker takes the attack's damage and suffers all the other consequences of getting struck with that attack. You cannot deflect attacks that miss you for any reason besides a failed attack roll (such as concealment). Similarly, you cannot deflect attacks that actually do strike you but simply fail to do any harm.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (D) or until discharged</p>
<p>When you consume this extract, you quickly consume another extract of your choice—this second extract's effects do not come into effect until a later point. You must consume this second, companion extract on the round following <em><a href="#delayed-consumption">delayed consumption</a></em> or waste the extract. The companion extract can be no higher than 4th level, and you must pay any costs associated with the companion extract when you consume it.</p>
<p>At any point during the duration of this extract, you can cause the companion extract to take effect as an immediate action. You can only have one <em><a href="#delayed-consumption">delayed consumption</a></em> in effect at one time. If a second is consumed, the first is dispelled without any effect.</p>

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You speak out against a single creature within line of sight and turn possible allies against it by drawing upon the power of your voice and conviction. Creatures in the area who can see the denounced creature must make a Will saving throw or have their <a href="../../skills/diplomacy.html">starting attitude</a> toward the denounced creature worsened by two levels. For example, creatures previously indifferent to the subject turn unfriendly. <a href="../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks made to reverse the effects of <em><a href="#denounce">denounce</a></em> are made at a -10 penalty.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round, then instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Reflex half; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You flood yourself with a potent surge of elemental energy. One round after completing the casting of the spell, the energy explodes from your body.</p>
<p>When this spell creates the explosion of energy, choose one of the following four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The explosion inflicts 1d8 points of damage of that energy type per caster level (maximum 10d8) to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet, and half that amount to targets past 15 feet but within 30 feet. You automatically take half damage from the explosion, without a saving throw, but any other energy resistance or energy immunity effects you may have in place can prevent or lessen this overflow damage caused by the explosion.</p>

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>This spell causes an eidolon to lose one evolution plus one additional evolution for every five caster levels. Evolutions with the highest total cost are lost first. If there is a tie, randomly determine which is lost. If this spell causes an eidolon to fail to meet the prerequisites for other evolutions or abilities, those evolutions or abilities are lost as long as this spell persists.</p>
<h2 id="discordant-blast">Discordant Blast</h2>

<p>You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst. Creatures in the area take 3d6 points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull rushed. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Charisma modifier. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A <em><a href="#discordant-blast">discordant blast</a></em> cannot penetrate a <em><a href="../../spells/silence.html#_silence">silence</a></em> spell (or any similar magical silence effect).</p>
<h2 id="divine-transfer">Divine Transfer</h2>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous + 1 round/level (see text)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>With a single touch, you transfer some of your life essence to the subject, transferring your hit points and your resolve. When you touch the subject you can transfer up to a number of hit points equal to your Constitution score to the target. These hit points heal the subject, but cannot raise the subject's hit points higher than its normal hit point total. In addition, the subject gains DR/evil equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) for the duration of the spell.</p>
<h2 id="divine-vessel">Divine Vessel</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [chaotic, evil, good, or lawful]; <strong>Level</strong> oracle 8</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p>You accept otherworldly energies into your body and transform. Your size increases by one category, your height doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. Your features shift into those of a cold and alien being of logic, a creature of primal chaos, an angelic presence, or a fiendish monster, as chosen by you. You gain a +6 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., and SR of 12 + your caster level. These modifiers replace the normal modifiers for increasing your size. The size modifier for AC, attacks, CMB, and CMD changes as appropriate for your new size category. This spell doesn't change your base speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate for your new size.</p>
<p>If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you—the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.</p>
<p>All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by this spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.</p>
<p>You gain additional abilities as noted below.</p>
<p><strong>Anarchic aspect</strong>: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Constitution, DR 10/lawful, resist acid 10, electricity 10, and sonic 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, blindsense 30 feet, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain a bite attack dealing 2d6 points of damage. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Axiomatic aspect</strong>: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/chaotic, resist cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Celestial aspect</strong>: You gain the following abilities: a +2 bonus to Dexterity, DR 10/evil, resist acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Fiendish aspect</strong>: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/good, resist acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, see in darkness, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 claw attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
<p>When used to assume an anarchic, axiomatic, celestial, or fiendish aspect, this spell is a chaotic, lawful, good, or evil spell respectively.</p>

<p><em><a href="#draconic-reservoir-">Draconic reservoir</a></em> functions as <em><a href="../../spells/protectionFromEnergy.html#_protection-from-energy">protection from energy</a></em>, absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and apply it to any melee attack, as if using an <em>acidic</em>, <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming">flaming</a></em>, <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-frost">frost</a></em>, or <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-shock">shock</a></em> weapon. The first creature the subject strikes with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other consequences of the attack. Releasing energy in this way does not “free up” space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type.

<p>The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act normally, but if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round and ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack. However, if the creature chooses to resist your efforts to move it, taking no other actions for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance bonus on its saving throw. The spell ends immediately if the target creature dies or is destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="enter-image">Enter Image</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 2, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a drop of paint and a ball of clay)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 50 ft./level</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> transfer consciousness to any object bearing your likeness</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You gain a dim impression of the activities around any object bearing your face or form and can also project your consciousness into one such object at a time, allowing you to observe or even interact with nearby creatures. This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check to notice it.</p>
<p>You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body's surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.</p>
<p>When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image.</p>
<p>You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed. The spell lasts until you cease concentrating, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as a <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> cast upon either the image or your body, or if your body is killed.</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a poppy flower)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none and Will partial (see below); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of euphoria. The target treats all creatures as dear friends and abhors violence, but may rise up to protect itself if violence is perpetrated against it. Until the end of the spell's duration, the creature's speed is halved, and it cannot make attacks or cast spells. If the creature is attacked, it gets a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature can make act normally for 1 round. If the saving throw fails, the creature moves half its speed away from the attacker as its next action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the creature is interacted with, or questioned while under the effects of this spell, it is considered to have an attitude of Helpful (see the <a href="../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> skill, <em>Core Rulebook</em> 94), though any advice or answers it gives may be disjointed or stream of consciousness due to its euphoric state.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell causes your eidolon to take on new characteristics. You can grant the eidolon any evolution whose total cost does not exceed 2 evolution points. You may only grant one evolution with this spell, even if that evolution can be taken multiple times. You can grant an evolution that allows you to spend additional evolution points to upgrade that evolution. This spell cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the eidolon already possesses. The eidolon must meet any prerequisites of the selected evolution. This spell does not allow an eidolon to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks.</p>
<h2 id="expeditious-excavation">Expeditious Excavation</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [earth]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> dirt in a 5-ft. cube</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around yourself, but the spell cannot be used for tunneling. Besides its mundane applications, you can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature's feet. A Medium or smaller creature falls prone in the pit unless it succeeds on a Reflex save. With a successful save, it can choose to land harmlessly on its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent square; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can escape a 5-foot-deep pit with a DC 5 <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> check. Larger creatures may ignore pits smaller than their size.</p>
<p>The earth excavated by this spell is ordinarily distributed harmlessly across the spell's range, but you may choose to throw up a burst of grit and debris when you dig a pit. This cloud of debris provides concealment to any creatures in the square affected and all adjacent squares for 1 round. <em><a href="#expeditious-excavation">Expeditious excavation</a></em> has no effect on solid rock or earth creatures.</p>

<p><strong>Area</strong> 20-ft.-radius burst</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect. A limited-use magical ability is any supernatural or spell-like ability which a creature can only activate a certain number of times during a set interval (3/day, 1/hour, etc.). The spell does not affect abilities which the creature can use at will or which are constant. It also does not apply to magical items or anything else external to a creature. A creature in the spell's area must make a Will saving throw or expend a single use of one of its abilities. Abilities with the greatest number of uses per day are affected first; if more than one ability has the same number of uses, randomly determine which one is affected first. Creatures must continue making Will saves, expending an additional use of an ability for each failed save, until they succeed, at which point the spell has no further effect.</p>
<h2 id="feast-of-ashes">Feast of Ashes</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>transmutation; <strong>Level</strong>druid 2, witch 2</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong>one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>2 days/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes</p>
<p>You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to <a href="../../environment.html#_starvation-and-thirst">starve</a>. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can counter the effect and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or potions). <em><a href="#feast-of-ashes">Feast of ashes</a></em> can be removed with a <em><a href="../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment">break enchantment</a>, <a href="../../spells/limitedWish.html#_limited-wish">limited wish</a>, <a href="../../spells/miracle.html#_miracle">miracle</a>, <a href="../../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse">remove curse</a>,</em>or <em><a href="../../spells/wish.html#_wish">wish</a></em> spell, but effects suffered as a result of starvation must be healed by normal means.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level or 1 round; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Necrotic energy permeates the target, blocking healing abilities. The subject gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level against effects that restore hit points or grant temporary hit points. In addition, any healing provided by effects that ignore spell resistance (such as fast healing, regeneration, and some spells) are halved. If the target succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw, <em><a href="#fester">fester</a></em> lasts</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p>This spell transforms your body into living flame. You and your equipment are immune to fire damage. In fact, every time you would normally take damage from fire, you are instead healed of damage at a rate of 1 point per 3 points of damage the fire attack would have normally inflicted. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells that affect your physiology or respiration. You take only half damage from acid or electricity. You take 150% as much damage from cold than normal.</p>
<p>You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score and a fly speed of 40 ft. (perfect maneuverability). Your unarmed attack deals an additional 3d6 points of fire damage, and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your body burns so brightly that creatures who do not avert their gaze from you are dazzled. Fire spells you cast have their save DCs increased by +1. If you enter water, you are surrounded by a 5-foot radius of steam and bubbles that grant you concealment (50% miss chance) but you take 2d6 points of damage each round you remain in water.</p>
<h2 id="firebrand">Firebrand</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [fire]; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 7</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless), but see below; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not cause damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the <em><a href="#firebrand">firebrand</a></em> burns, any creature it marks is immune to damage from any fire spell you cast. All of the target's weapons (both natural and manufactured) inflict +1d6 points of fire damage on a hit (this bonus fire damage stacks with any amount of fire damage a creature's weapons might already inflict). At any point during the spell's duration, a creature bearing a <em><a href="#firebrand">firebrand</a></em> can launch a beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as a swift action. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Once a creature uses its <em><a href="#firebrand">firebrand</a></em> to fire a ray in this manner, the effects of the spell end for that creature.</p>

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex half; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Up to thrice during this spell's duration, you can belch forth a cone of fire as a standard action. The first cone deals 4d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area.

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates and Reflex negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p><em><a href="#firefall">Firefall</a></em>causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly bright liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage per caster level (no saving throw).</p>
<p>The coruscating rain of fire fills a hemispherical burst with a radius of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in the area take 5d6 points of fire damage and catch on fire (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 444). Creatures who make successful Reflex saves take half damage and don't catch on fire. Creatures within 120 feet of the original fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite evil class ability is engulfed in flames of positive energy. At the start of its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, and takes an additional 1d6 points of damage each time it attacks a creature other than you. If the creature is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature this damage increases to 1d10. With a successful saving throw, a creature is affected by this spell for only 1 round. This damage is divine in nature and bypasses any DR the creature possesses.</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> weapon touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (object, harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (object, harmless)</p>
<p>With a touch, you cause a glowing rune to appear on a single weapon, granting that weapon the <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming">flaming</a></em> property (and allowing it to cause an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit). If you are using the judgment class feature, your weapon gains the <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst">flaming burst</a></em> property instead. The spell functions only for weapons that you wield. If the weapon leaves your hand for any reason, the spell effect ends. The effects of this spell do not stack with any existing <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming">flaming</a></em> or <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst">flaming burst</a></em> weapon property that the target weapon may already possess.</p>

<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [water]; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 4, sorcerer/wizard 6</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, your body takes on a slick, oily appearance. For the duration of this spell, your form can stretch and shift with ease and becomes slightly transparent, as if you were composed of liquid. This transparency is not enough to grant concealment. You gain DR 10/slashing and your reach increases by 10 feet. In addition, you can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with anything you were carrying at the time the spell was cast (except other creatures). Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect. You are treated as if you had the water subtype while this spell is in effect.</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level (D)</p>
<p>Choose one alignment type: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You gain the ability to follow the trail of a strong or overwhelming aura of that alignment (see <em><a href="../../spells/detectEvil.html#_detect-evil">detect evil</a></em>, <em>Core Rulebook</em> 266). This is treated as tracking using the scent special quality, except you are following the traces of their aura upon the ground rather than their scent, and you receive no bonus on <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks. At 10th level, you can track the trail of creatures with a moderate alignment aura as well.</p>
<p>When you use this spell to track a given alignment, it gains the descriptor of the opposite alignment. For example, when <em><a href="#follow-aura">follow aura</a></em> is used to track evil, it gains the good descriptor.</p>
<h2 id="fools-forbiddance">Fool's Forbiddance</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 6</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> 10 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Through your antics and performance, you create an area of warding that adversely affects all enemies that dare enter it. When an enemy creature enters the area it must make an immediate Will saving throw. If it fails, the creature is confused as long as it is in the area and for 1 round after it leaves. If it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is staggered as long as it is in the area and for 1 round after it leaves.</p>
<h2 id="forced-repentance">Forced Repentance</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 4, paladin 4</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one evil creature without the evil subtype</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You force an evil creature that does not have the evil subtype to momentarily reflect on its past actions and be overcome by grief and conscience. The target immediately drops prone and begins to loudly confess all of its sins and transgressions to the caster for the duration of the spell. The spell immediately ends if you move out of line of sight or if the target is attacked.</p>
<h2 id="frozen-note">Frozen Note</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> any number of creatures within area</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their surroundings so long as you maintain the note. Maintaining this note requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other action, including moving from your current square, the spell instantly ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial saving throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice greater than your caster level are not affected by this spell. However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a saving throw to resist it. The note is so clear and flawless that less than extraordinary attempts to avoid hearing it merely grant targets a bonus on their saving throws. Targets get a +2 circumstance bonus on their saving throw for each barrier between your voice and their ears. This includes such things as a creature stopping up its ears with wax, closing all windows and doors in a nearby building, or even crawling into a barrel and pulling down the top. If a target that had previously made its saving throw loses the benefit of one or more of its barriers it must immediately make a new saving throw. Similarly, any target that had previously failed its saving throw gets a new save each time it gains the protection of a barrier.</p>
<h2 id="gallant-inspiration">Gallant Inspiration</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>This word of arcane-empowered inspiration often ensures success of a crucial endeavor. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The creature gains a +2d4 competence bonus to the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the roll succeeds.</p>
<h2 id="getaway">Getaway</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (teleportation); <strong>Level</strong> bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a brass doorknob)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> unlimited</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong> you and one willing creature/2 levels, all of which must be within 30 feet of you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p><em><a href="#getaway-">Getaway</a></em> teleports you and allies you designate at the time of casting to a predetermined location. You must initially cast the spell at that location—all creatures affected by the spell must be present at that time and within 30 feet of you. At any time before the spell's duration expires, you may trigger the spell as a swift action. At this time, all affected creatures (or their remains and gear) within 30 feet of you are teleported to the location where you first cast the spell. Creatures more than 30 feet away from you are left behind. Selected creatures within 30 feet of you who do not wish to travel with you at that time can simply choose not to go. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.</p>
<h2 id="geyser">Geyser</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [fire, water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a piece of lava rock)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> spout of boiling water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying upward 10 ft./2 levels</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration + 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex partial (see below); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any horizontal surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby creatures to searing droplets as its spray falls back to the ground.</p>
<p>Any creature entering the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em>, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> (e.g., if the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em>. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement.</p>
<p>In addition, the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em>'s height (e.g., a 50-foot <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.</p>
<p>You can choose to make a smaller <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height <em><a href="#geyser-">geyser</a></em> spell.</p>
<h2 id="ghostbane-dirge">Ghostbane Dirge</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one incorporeal creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>The target coalesces into a semi-physical form for a short period of time. While subject to the spell, the incorporeal creature takes half damage (50%) from nonmagical attack forms, and full damage from magic</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one incorporeal creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>

<h2 id="glide">Glide</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 2, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2, witch 2</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> until landing or 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p>You take no damage from falls (as if from <em><a href="../../spells/featherFall.html#_feather-fall">feather fall</a></em>). In addition, you can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot you fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. You cannot use this spell to actually gain height, merely coast in other directions as you fall. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes you to rise you can take advantage of it in order to increase the distance you can glide. The spell ends as soon as your feet touch the ground regardless of its remaining duration. If the spell expires while you are still in the air you fall the remaining distance as normal.</p>
<h2 id="grace">Grace</h2>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p><em><a href="#gravity-bow-">Gravity bow</a></em> significantly increases the weight and density of arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they strike their target and then return them to normal a few moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the spell is cast deals damage as if one size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from a <em><a href="#gravity-bow-">gravity bow</a></em>. Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.</p>
<h2 id="grove-of-respite">Grove of Respite</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong>druid 4, ranger 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Component</strong>V, S, M/DF (a leaf or blade of grass and a drop of water)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> 20-ft.-radius grove</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>2 hours/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>no</p>
<p>You conjure a sheltered grove of trees surrounding a shallow spring. The grove appears from nowhere even in the most barren, rocky soil regardless of season, but the spell must be cast outside on open ground.</p>
<p>The area within the grove is temperate and comfortable, like that of a <em><a href="../../spells/tinyHut.html#_tiny-hut">tiny hut</a>,</em> although the grove provides no illumination and provides no protection from the elements. The water in the grove's spring is clean and drinkable. Additionally, the trees provide a variety of ripe fruit, regardless of season, which acts as a <em><a href="../../spells/goodberry.html#_goodberry">goodberry</a></em>spell for up to eight people. The grove is warded with an <em><a href="../../spells/alarm.html#_alarm">alarm</a></em> spell that alerts you whenever any creature enters the area. Once the spell expires, the grove vanishes, including all fruit, water, and other materials from it, although any nourishment or healing gained from its effects remains.</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a spool of thread or string)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (D)</p>
<p>You form a bond with your surroundings when you cast this spell. For the remaining duration of the spell you can always, as a standard action, determine your approximate distance from that area as well as the direction you must travel in order to reach it. You cannot determine the location of the area if you are on a different plane. The area counts as ”very familiar” for the purposes of <em><a href="../../spells/teleport.html#_teleport">teleport</a></em> or similar spells. You can only attune yourself to one location at a time. If you cast the spell at another spot you lose the ability to locate your original area.</p>

Each target gains a +10 competence bonus on <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> checks to send secret message to other recipients. Others using opposed <a href="../../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks to decipher these messages receive a -5 penalty. All subjects affected by the spell must share a language to be able to pass messages.</p>

<p>You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the surrounding terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any activity going on inside the area—they cannot smell campfires or cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those inside the area can see out normally. Once a creature steps into the area of the spell, it can see everything in and around the area normally.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p>This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects of spell, you roll two dice each time you make a <a href="../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check to change a creature's attitude, taking the highest roll. If this results in a roll low enough to reduce the creature's attitude by a step, that creature gets some clue that you are manipulating it with a spell. Alternatively you can cast this spell before making a <a href="../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check to gather information, gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check.</p>
<h2 id="hungry-pit">Hungry Pit</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 5</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates; Reflex half; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell functions as <em><a href="createPit.html#_create-pit-">create pit</a></em>, except that the pit has the ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it and has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the hole take falling damage as normal. In addition, anyone within the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round as the pit contracts and then returns to its normal size (a successful Reflex save halves this damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to scale and have a <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> DC of 35.</p>
<h2 id="hunters-eye">Hunter's Eye</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 3, ranger 2</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, <em><a href="#hunter&#39;s-eye">hunter's eye</a></em> greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the <em><a href="../../spells/seeInvisibility.html#_see-invisibility">see invisibility</a></em> spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, <em><a href="../../spells/blur.html#_blur">blur</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/displacement.html#_displacement">displacement</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility">invisibility</a></em>, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.</p>
<h2 id="hunters-howl">Hunter's Howl</h2>

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> none</p>
<p>With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents. Until the end of the spell's duration, you treat those affected by it as if they were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a>, <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a>, <a href="../../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, and <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks against them.

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature or object</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. <em><a href="#hydraulic-push-">Hydraulic push</a></em> extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.</p>
<h2 id="hydraulic-torrent">Hydraulic Torrent</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 60 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 60-ft. line</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Against creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to make a Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting to break an object, the stream has an effective Strength equal to your caster level plus the ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object you're trying to break—see <a href="http://paizo.com/prd/additionalRules.html#_breaking-items">Breaking Items</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="#hydraulic-torrent-">Hydraulic torrent</a></em> extinguishes any normal fires it encounters along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level or until discharged</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You afflict the target with bad luck. On the next d20 roll the target makes, it must roll twice and take the less favorable result. For every five caster levels you have, the target must roll twice on an additional d20 roll (to a maximum of five rolls at 20th level).</p>
<p>A target who can speak and has at least one free hand and who is aware of the spell and its effects (such as from a <a href="../../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> check to identify the spell as it is cast) can negate one reroll by spending a move action to utter a brief prayer or good luck charm to appease the spirits of ill fortune.</p>
<h2 id="innocence">Innocence</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>transmutation; <strong>Level</strong>bard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p>You surround yourself with an aura of innocence and trustworthiness. You gain a +10 competence bonus on <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> skill checks to convince others of your innocence. They find it difficult to believe you capable of any wrongdoing. This bonus does not apply to other uses of the <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating secret messages via innuendo, nor does it apply to any use of the skill to convince anyone of anything other than your complete innocence and blamelessness.</p>
<h2 id="instant-armor">Instant Armor</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [force]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 2, paladin 2</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p>You instantly wrap your body in a suit of armor made from opaque force. At your option, the armor can be decorated with your religion's holy symbol in a prominent place, such as upon the breastplate or helm. While it exists, this armor replaces any garments or other sort of armor worn, magical as well as mundane. You lose access to, and all benefits from, armor replaced by this spell until the spell ends and the instant armor disappears.</p>
<p><em><a href="#instant-armor-">Instant armor</a></em> acts in all ways as armor typical of its type (armor bonus, maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and so on). Since <em><a href="#instant-armor-">instant armor</a></em> is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor. The sort of armor you can create with this spell depends on your caster level.</p>

<p>If you choose to create lesser armor than your level allows you gain a +1 magical enhancement bonus to the armor you do create for every type of armor you pass over. For instance, if you have the capacity to create full plate <em><a href="#instant-armor-">instant armor</a></em> you could instead choose to create <em>+1 half-plate</em>, <em>+2 banded mail</em>, or <em>+3 chainmail</em>.

<p><strong>Duration</strong>10 minutes/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes (harmless)</p>
<p>This spell banishes feelings of weariness. For the duration, the subject takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. The effect of <em><a href="#invigorate">invigorate</a></em> is merely an illusion, however, not a substitute for actual rest or respite. When the spell ends, the subject takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the return of the original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only one <em><a href="#invigorate">invigorate</a></em> spell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that creature, the first effect immediately ends.</p>
<p><strong>School</strong>illusion [figment]; <strong>Level</strong>bard 3</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You compel an enemy to come and fight you. On its turn, the target moves its speed toward you, avoiding any other dangers along its path (including any movement that would provoke attacks of opportunity).

<p><em><a href="#lead-blades-">Lead blades</a></em> increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from <em><a href="#lead-blades-">lead blades</a></em>.

<h2 id="life-bubble">Life Bubble</h2>

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You surround the touched creatures with a constant and moveable 1-inch shell of tolerable living conditions. This shell enables the subjects to breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons and spells like <em><a href="../../spells/cloudkill.html#_cloudkill">cloudkill</a></em> and <em><a href="../../spells/stinkingCloud.html#_stinking-cloud">stinking cloud</a></em>. In addition, the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per <em><a href="../../spells/endureElements.html#_endure-elements">endure elements</a></em>) as well as extremes of pressure.</p>
<p><em><a href="#life-bubble-">Life bubble</a></em> does not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater).</p>

<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [good, light]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 2</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> lance of light</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round + 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p>You create a glorious beam of brilliant radiance that acts as a <em>+1 <a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-holy">holy</a> lance</em> suitable for your size. You must have a free hand when casting the spell and, once you call the lance into being, you cannot switch it to another hand or put it down without prematurely ending the spell. As a standard action while holding a <em><a href="#light-lance-">light lance</a></em>, you can choose not to make an attack and instead hold the lance aloft as a beacon of light and truth, creating an area of bright light with a radius of 90 feet. If you choose to do this for one or more additional rounds the lance also casts a spear of brilliant light up into the sky that grows progressively more visible as it continues to climb toward the heavens. Under cover of night or other darkness, if nothing obstructs the beam, it becomes visible for an additional 2 miles during each round in which you continue to aim your lance skyward (2 miles in the second round, 4 miles in the third round, and so on).</p>
<h2 id="lily-pad-stride">Lily Pad Stride</h2>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> trail of lily pads behind you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level (D); see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>Your every footstep creates aquatic plants capable of supporting your weight and that of any creature of your size or smaller that is following you. These lily pads only appear when you cross water or other liquids which do not immediately destroy plants. You can walk across these liquid surfaces without any fear of stumbling (though if knocked prone, dragged under, or otherwise pulled off your feet you still sink in the liquid). For the duration of the spell, any creature of your size or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a DC 10 <a href="../../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check every round. Each such check allows it to move at half its normal land speed. If the creature takes a -5 penalty on its check it can move at its normal speed. If a creature fails an <a href="../../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check, or if a creature that's larger than you attempts to follow, it falls through, damaging the plants. Each time a creature falls through, all subsequent creatures take a cumulative -5 penalty on their <a href="../../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks when traveling across that particular stretch of plants. As you move, the lily pads disappear behind you once you pass beyond the spell's range. Otherwise, they remain until the spell's duration expires.</p>
<h2 id="lockjaw">Lockjaw</h2>

The creature gains the grab ability with that natural attack, including the +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to start or maintain a grapple. A creature with multiple natural attacks can strike at its grappled opponent with its other natural attacks, but cannot attack any other creature.</p>
<h2 id="marks-of-forbiddance">Marks Of Forbiddance</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 3</p>

<p><strong>Targets</strong>one enemy and one ally</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p><em>Marks of <a href="../../spells/forbiddance.html#_forbiddance">Forbiddance</a></em>magically brand two creatures, preventing them from committing violence against one another. When you cast this spell choose one enemy and one ally within range. Both targets become branded with the sigil of forbiddance. Until the end of the spell's duration, in order for the two targets to attack one another, even with a targeted spell, each attacker must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, that target can attack the other normally. If the save fails, the target can't follow through with the attack and the action is lost. This spell does not prevent the targets from attacking each other with area of effect spells or abilities.</p>
<h2 id="mask-dweomer">Mask Dweomer</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong> creature or object touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You mask and manipulate a spell's magic aura to make it harder to detect. Select one spell effect on the target creature or object. You must have either cast this spell yourself or have perceived it by means such as <em><a href="../../spells/detectMagic.html#_detect-magic">detect magic</a></em> or <em><a href="../../spells/arcaneSight.html#_arcane-sight">arcane sight</a></em>. Both the desired spell effect and <em><a href="#mask-dweomer">mask dweomer</a></em> are hidden from <em><a href="../../spells/detectMagic.html#_detect-magic">detect magic</a></em>, although more powerful spells (such as <em><a href="../../spells/arcaneSight.html#_arcane-sight">arcane sight</a></em>) pierce the deception if the caster succeeds on a Will save. <em><a href="../../spells/analyzeDweomer.html#_analyze-dweomer">Analyze dweomer</a></em> automatically detects both <em><a href="#mask-dweomer">mask dweomer</a></em> and any masked spell effects.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a <a href="../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, <a href="../../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a>, or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one humanoid creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen. The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage appropriate for the creature's size, and for the remainder of the spell's duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous <em><a href="../../spells/rage.html#_rage">rage</a></em> and <em><a href="../../spells/confusion.html#_confusion">confusion</a></em> spells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference to other actions. During the final round of the spell's duration, the target is again dazed as it returns to its normal state.</p>
<h2 id="nap-stack">Nap Stack</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a little silk pillow worth 100 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 30 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 30-ft.-radius emanation</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest creatures within the spell's area need in order to recover from injuries, regain spells, or other special abilities to 2 hours instead of the normal eight. In addition, if creatures continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2 hours, every additional 2 hours counts as a day of rest for the purpose of recovering hit points, ability damage, as well as for enduring diseases, poisons, or other afflictions. This means 8 total hours of sleep counts as 4 days for natural healing and for saving throws as diseases or similar afflictions run their course. When suffering from diseases, poison, or other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams that help them track their recovery. If things go poorly they can, at any time, wake themselves up in order to seek a better alternative. If awoken or otherwise disturbed during this 8-hour period, creatures may return to sleep but they no longer enjoy the benefits of the accelerated recovery time. Creatures can only enjoy the benefits of this spell once in any 1-week period.</p>
<h2 id="natural-rhythm">Natural Rhythm</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a handful of pebbles dropped one by one onto the ground)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You enhance a creature's ability to harm an opponent based on the number of times it has already injured that opponent with a natural attack. Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls made against that opponent when making natural attacks (maximum +5 bonus). If an attack misses, the bonus to damage for all attacks resets to +0.</p>
<h2 id="natures-exile">Nature's Exile</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong>creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>permanent</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes</p>
<p>This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the target. Familiars, being magical beasts, are not affected by this spell, but animal companions are. If you have an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as you remain cursed, your animal companion takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. The target also takes a -10 penalty on <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> skill checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.</p>
<p><em><a href="#nature&#39;s-exile">Nature's exile</a></em> can be removed with <em><a href="../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment">break enchantment</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/limitedWish.html#_limited-wish">limited wish</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/miracle.html#_miracle">miracle</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse">remove curse</a></em>, or <em><a href="../../spells/wish.html#_wish">wish</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="negate-aroma">Negate Aroma</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 1, druid 1, ranger 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a pinch of alum)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature or object/level touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>With a gesture, this spell allows you to dismiss even the foulest or most distinctive scents. When cast, the targeted creatures or objects lose all natural and unnatural odors. A creature under the effect of <em><a href="#negate-aroma">negate aroma</a></em> cannot be tracked, located, or pinpointed by the scent special quality. In addition, this spell prevents the target creature from using the stench special ability and similar odor-based abilities (such as those possessed by troglodytes).</p>
<p><em><a href="#negate-aroma">Negate aroma</a></em> does not prevent the target from acquiring outside smells or odors. Dowsing the creature with a pungent substance effectively negates the benefits of the spell until the substance is neutralized or washed away.</p>
<h2 id="oath-of-peace">Oath of Peace</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p>Entreating your deity for aid, you make a temporary oath of peace, granting you superior defenses but means you can't attack for the duration of the oath. For as long as you are subject to this spell, you gain a +5 sacred bonus to AC and on saving throws, as well as DR 10/evil. If you make a direct or indirect attack or any show any hostility toward any creature, the spell immediately ends.</p>
<h2 id="oracles-burden">Oracle's Burden</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> oracle 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You entreat the forces of fate to bestow your oracle's curse upon another creature. The target creature suffers all the hindrances and none of the benefits of your oracle's curse class feature. You still suffer all effects of your oracle's curse. If you do not have the oracle's curse class feature, this spell has no effect.</p>
<h2 id="pain-strike">Pain Strike</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>evocation [evil]; <strong>Level</strong>sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong>one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes</p>
<p><em><a href="#pain-strike">Pain strike</a></em>racks the targeted creature with agony, inflicting 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round for 1 round per level (maximum 10 rounds). Additionally, the affected creature is sickened for the spell's duration, and the caster gains a +4 circumstance bonus on <a href="../../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks against the target.</p>
<p><strong>School</strong>evocation [evil]; <strong>Level</strong>sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong>one living creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p>This spell works like <em><a href="#pain-strike">pain strike</a>,</em>except as noted above.</p>
<h2 id="paladins-sacrifice">Paladin's Sacrifice</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 immediate action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You open up a brief but powerful divine conduit between you and another creature, taking on the damage and any other effects that creature suffers. When a creature in range is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can cast this spell and the wounds and/or effects are magically transmitted to you instead of the target. You are affected as if you were hit by the attack or failed the saving throw, taking all the damage and suffering all of the adverse effects. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects in any way.</p>
<p>If you use this spell against an effect that also targets you or includes you in its area, you suffer the effects for both yourself and the target you spared, potentially taking damage or suffering other consequences twice.</p>
<h2 id="perceive-cues">Perceive Cues</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 2, inquisitor 2, ranger 2, witch 2</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a drop of water)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p>Your senses become preternaturally keen, and you gain insight into subtle behavioral cues. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +5 competence bonus on <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> and <a href="../../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks.</p>
<h2 id="phantasmal-revenge">Phantasmal Revenge</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 7</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch and unlimited; see text</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> dead body touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will disbelief then Fortitude partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking for vengeance before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light. This phantom then unerringly seeks out the creature that killed it, as long as that creature is on the same plane, and tries to slay its killer in turn.</p>
<p>Only the corpse's killer can see the phantasmal image created by this spell. You and any others who witness the spell's casting or its ultimate effects see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. If that save fails, the target must succeed on Fortitude saving throw or take 10 points of damage per caster level from the phantasmal image. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. You know immediately if the spell succeeded or failed to kill its target but gain no other information, including the identity of the target of the spell.</p>
<p>The creature providing the corpse must have died no more than 1 day per caster level prior to the casting of this spell. If the creature that provided the corpse was not, in fact, killed by another, or if the killer is dead or no longer on the same plane, the spell fails. <em><a href="#phantasmal-revenge">Phantasmal revenge</a></em> makes no moral judgments; it targets winners of fair fights just as easily as murderers. Any given body can only be targeted by a <em><a href="#phantasmal-revenge">phantasmal revenge</a></em> spell once.</p>
<h2 id="phantasmal-web">Phantasmal Web</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature/level, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that they are engulfed in tangled webs teeming with swarms of tiny spiders. Those who fail to disbelieve the <em><a href="#phantasmal-web">phantasmal web</a></em> are treated as if in a <em><a href="../../spells/web.html#_web">web</a></em> spell, but must also make a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn or become nauseated for that round by the phantasmal spiders.</p>
<p>As the <em><a href="#phantasmal-web">phantasmal web</a></em> exists only in the minds of the targets, it cannot be burned or destroyed, and it provides no cover (though it does provide concealment) against attacks made by the targets. Targets cannot escape the <em><a href="#phantasmal-web">phantasmal web</a></em> by moving, even by <em>teleportation</em>. <em><a href="../../spells/freedomOfMovement.html#_freedom-of-movement">Freedom of movement</a></em> allows unobstructed movement but does not negate the concealment or nausea effects.</p>
<p>Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be engulfed in webs and swarming spiders, but the spell has no visible effect to other creatures (who may assist allies to disbelieve the effect).</p>
<h2 id="pied-piping">Pied Piping</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V or F (musical instrument)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 90 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 90-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration + 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You call forth a melody so compelling and attractive that creatures belonging to a group with a specific, identifiable physical trait (such as type, subtype, age, gender, or hair color) find it almost impossible not to approach and follow you. You choose the nature of the creatures you seek to attract when you cast the spell and, once you make this choice, cannot alter it. You can only use physical traits to determine your audience. You can never use social and other more voluntary criteria (such as alignment, religion, nationality, or class) to select targets for this spell.</p>
<p>Eligible creatures must make a saving throw each round spent within the area of the spell and, once they fail, approach you at their normal movement speed and stand as close to you as possible without actually entering an occupied square. If you move, they do their best to maintain their proximity to you and follow. Affected creatures can take no actions other than listening to your music and following you if you move. Those entering the area while the spell is in effect must also successfully save or be compelled to come to you.</p>
<p>The attractive power of the spell does not cause affected creatures to put themselves in jeopardy and they have enough presence of mind to avoid or negotiate around obstacles and other perilous hazards. If unable to approach or follow you without endangering themselves, they simply wait, swaying to the music, until you pass out of range, at which point they regain their senses after 1 round/caster level. If circumstances change once you move out of range, making it possible for affected creatures to resume their attempts to get near you they do so, and, if they manage to return to within the area of the spell before it wears off, the spell continues as normal. If attacked, affected creatures can take defensive measures, even going so far as to avoid existing threats by moving out of the area of the spell, but cannot make attacks themselves or take any other actions until the effects of the spell wear off. The effects of the spell persist for 1 round/caster level even after you stop concentrating. Once the spell ceases, the affected creatures continue to stay near you until the effects of the spell wear off.</p>
<h2 id="pillar-of-life">Pillar of Life</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (healing) [light]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> 5-ft.-square pillar of positive energy, 20 ft. high</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You conjure a pillar of positive energy in a single 5-foot square within range that radiates light as if it were a sunrod. Living creatures adjacent to the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar and heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Creatures can move into the square containing the pillar, but if an undead creature moves into the pillar it takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures vulnerable to bright light take 1d8 points if damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A creature cannot benefit or suffer more than once from a single casting of this spell.</p>

<p><em><a href="#planar-adaptation">Planar adaptation</a></em>grants you immunity to the harmful environmental effects of a particular plane of existence, including such hazards as toxicity, extreme temperatures, and lack of air. Additionally, you gain energy resistance 20 to a single energy type prevalent on that plane (choose one if more than one type is equally prevalent). <em><a href="#planar-adaptation">Planar adaptation</a></em> has no effect when cast upon your native plane.</p>
<p><strong>Planar Adaptation, Mass</strong></p>

<p><strong>Targets</strong>one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes (harmless)</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target is sickened and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.</p>
<h2 id="protective-spirit">Protective Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> ranger 2</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p>A <em><a href="#protective-spirit">protective spirit</a></em> is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the <em><a href="#protective-spirit">protective spirit</a></em> makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A <em><a href="#protective-spirit">protective spirit</a></em> can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.</p>
<p>A <em><a href="#protective-spirit">protective spirit</a></em> occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/disintegrate.html#_disintegrate">disintegrate</a></em>, a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, or a <em><a href="../../magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation">rod of cancellation</a></em> affects it.

<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, removing one of the following conditions on a creature within range affected by your bardic performance: cowering, dazzled, exhausted, paralyzed, shaken, or stunned.</p>
<h2 id="purified-calling">Purified Calling</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (healing); <strong>Level</strong> summoner 4</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a stick of incense)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>Your eidolon is restored to full health when you summon it. Upon casting this spell, you must immediately begin the ritual to summon your eidolon. Upon completion of the ritual, your eidolon appears at full hit points and without any damage or penalties to its ability scores, regardless of its previous condition. In addition, any temporary negative conditions affecting your eidolon are immediately removed. Permanent conditions and ability drain are not affected by this spell.</p>
<h2 id="putrefy-food-and-drink">Putrefy Food and Drink</h2>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (object)</p>
<p>This spell causes otherwise edible food to rot and spoil instantly, and water and other liquids to become brackish and undrinkable. Holy water and similar food and drink of significance are spoiled by <em><a href="#putrefy-food-and-drink">putrefy food and drink</a></em>, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon unholy water. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.</p>
<p>Although potions and elixirs are unaffected by the normal use of the spell, you can instead choose to target a single such object with this spell, destroying it if it fails a saving throw.</p>
<h2 id="rally-point">Rally Point</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [good, mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 1</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You create a spot that has the power to briefly hearten any good creature who comes into contact with it. A good creature who enters this square (even if simply as part of its normal move) gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks, saving throws, and 2 temporary hit points per caster level for 1 round. Nongood creatures gain no benefit from this spell. A creature cannot benefit more than once from the same casting of this spell.</p>
<h2 id="rampart">Rampart</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [earth]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Effect</strong> 10-ft.-high earthen wall, in a line up to 10 ft. long/2 levels, or a circle with radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a massive rampart of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet thick. The <em><a href="#rampart">rampart</a></em> cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the <em><a href="#rampart">rampart</a></em> has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the <em><a href="#rampart">rampart</a></em> whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the <em><a href="#rampart">rampart</a></em> with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the <em><a href="#rampart">rampart</a></em> with a DC 20 <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> check.</p>

<p><strong>Area</strong> 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Your wrathful words cause physical harm to your enemies. Your enemies take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) and are staggered for 1 round. Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks. <em><a href="#rebuke">Rebuke</a></em> is especially devastating to foes who worship your god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and stunning them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggering or stunning effect.</p>
<p>Enemies do not need to hear a <em><a href="#rebuke">rebuke</a></em> to be harmed by it, but it is negated by magical silence.</p>
<h2 id="rejuvenate-eidolon">Rejuvenate Eidolon</h2>

<p><strong>Target</strong> eidolon touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>By laying your hand upon an eidolon, you cause its wounds to close and its form to solidify. This spell cures 1d10 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).</p>
<h2 id="residual-tracking">Residual Tracking</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination; <strong>Level</strong> ranger 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a bit of plaster)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> footprint touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>By touching a footprint, you receive a clear mental image of the person or creature that made it. The image has the exact same appearance as the creature that made the footprint at the moment it made the imprint, including any telling features or expressions, any gear or equipment, or anything else the creature was carrying at the time. For example, the footprint of a horse would reveal both the horse and any creature riding it when it made the footprint.</p>
<h2 id="resounding-blow">Resounding Blow</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [sonic]; <strong>Level</strong> antipaladin 4, inquisitor 5, paladin 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 swift action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You must have a melee weapon in hand to cast this spell. On a successful melee attack, your weapon resounds with a thunderous clash. The target takes 1d6 points of sonic damage. Your weapon is not harmed by this attack.</p>
<p>If you are using your judgment ability or smite ability against the target, it is staggered for 1 round on a successful attack. A successful Fortitude save negates the staggering effect.</p>
<p>On a successful critical hit, the target is stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and deafening effects. If you are also using judgment or smite, your foe makes only a single save against all effects.</p>
<p>This spell immediately ends if your weapon leaves your hand. <em><a href="#resounding-blow">Resounding blow</a></em> stacks with the <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_thundering">thundering</a></em> weapon property.</p>
<h2 id="rest-eternal">Rest Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 4, druid 5, witch 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (ashes and a vial of holy or unholy water)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one dead creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> permanent</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You place a curse upon a dead creature that bars its spirit from returning. Anyone casting a spell that would communicate with the dead creature, return it to life, or turn it into an undead creature must succeed on a caster level check with a DC of 11 plus your caster level. <em><a href="#rest-eternal">Rest eternal</a></em> cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated with <em><a href="../../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse">remove curse</a></em> or <em><a href="../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment">break enchantment</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="restful-sleep">Restful Sleep</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> bard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of sand)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 8 hours or 24 hours; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the effects of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night's sleep. If a subject completes a full night's rest, it regains hit points as if it had undergone a full day of bed rest (regaining twice its character level in hit points). If a subject completes a full day's rest, it regains three times its character level in hit points. Any significant interruption during the rest (such as being awoken) prevents any healing that night and ends the effect of this spell on the awakened subject. Any healing acquired while under the effects of <em><a href="#restful-sleep">restful sleep</a></em> is considered natural healing, and has no affect on effects requiring magical healing to cure.</p>
<h2 id="resurgent-transformation">Resurgent Transformation</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (healing); <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of meteoric iron worth 100 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level or until triggered, then 1 round/level</p>
<p><em><a href="#resurgent-transformation">Resurgent transformation</a></em> grants you the ability to recover from deadly wounds with restored vitality and a will to fight, but at a price. Once cast, <em><a href="#resurgent-transformation">resurgent transformation</a></em> lies dormant for up to 1 hour per level until you are reduced to one-quarter hit points or less. Once triggered, you immediately gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, damage reduction 5/—, and the benefits of a <em><a href="../../spells/haste.html#_haste">haste</a></em> spell. In addition, you heal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). <em><a href="#resurgent-transformation">Resurgent transformation</a></em> can even save you from death by healing the damage from an otherwise mortal wound, though it does not prevent death from massive damage or from causes other than hit point loss. Your mental faculties are impaired by this magical transformation, however, causing 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage.</p>
<p>The advantages from your transformation persist for 1 round per caster level after the spell is triggered. Once the spell ends, it takes a heavy toll, leaving you exhausted and inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Utilizing more than one <em><a href="#resurgent-transformation">resurgent transformation</a></em> in a day is particularly risky. The expiration of a second <em><a href="#resurgent-transformation">resurgent transformation</a></em> in a 24-hour period inflicts an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage and results in death from system shock unless you succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, made after the Constitution damage has been applied.</p>
<p>If the spell expires or is dispelled before the <em>transformation</em> has been triggered, no adverse effects result.</p>
<h2 id="retribution">Retribution</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy [evil]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature who has just struck you with an attack</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p><em><a href="#retribution">Retribution</a></em> blasts those who have the temerity to assault your person. You may target anyone who has just struck you with an attack within the previous round, whether with a melee, ranged, or natural weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll. The target is wracked with shooting pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skills checks, and ability checks. On a successful Fortitude save, the penalty only lasts for 1 round. A target who worships the same god as you takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.</p>
<h2 id="reviving-finale">Reviving Finale</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (healing); <strong>Level</strong> bard 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 swift action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 20 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will half (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, and allies within the area of the spell regain 2d6 hit points. This spell has no effect on undead creatures.</p>
<h2 id="righteous-vigor">Righteous Vigor</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 3, paladin 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>Infusing the target with a surge of furious divine energy, you enhance a creature's ability to hit an opponent based on the number of times it has already hit that opponent with a successful attack. Each time the subject successfully strikes an opponent with a successful melee attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus on attack rolls (maximum +4 bonus) and gains 1d8 temporary hit points (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). If an attack misses, the attack bonus resets to +0 but any accumulated temporary hit points remain. The temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration.</p>
<h2 id="river-of-wind">River of Wind</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [air]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> 120 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 120-ft. line</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind—the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in a <em><a href="#river-of-wind">river of wind</a></em> take 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone.</p>
<p>A creature that begins its turn wholly or partially within a <em><a href="#river-of-wind">river of wind</a></em> must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 20 feet in the wind's direction of flow, take 2d6 nonlethal damage, and be knocked prone—a successful Fortitude save means the creature merely takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. Creatures under the effect of <em><a href="../../spells/freedomOfMovement.html#_freedom-of-movement">freedom of movement</a></em> and creatures with the air subtype are unaffected by a <em><a href="#river-of-wind">river of wind</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="sacred-bond">Sacred Bond</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (healing); <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3, inquisitor 2, paladin 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, F (a pair of golden bracelets worth 100 gp each worn by both you and the target)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch; see text</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>To use this spell, you first touch the intended recipient, creating a sympathetic field of healing energies between you. Once the spell has been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells with a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Should either you or the target remove your bracelet, the spell immediately ends.</p>
<h2 id="sacrificial-oath">Sacrificial Oath</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature. Until the end of the spell's duration, each time the target is hit with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that attack and any other effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to take on the damage and effects, you instead take a number of points of damage equal to your Constitution score as backlash. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects of either the transfer or the backlash. If you or the subject of the spell move out of line of sight, the spell ends.</p>
<h2 id="saddle-surge">Saddle Surge</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong> you and your mount</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D); see text</p>
<p>You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet your mount moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on <a href="../../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> checks and both you and your mount gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with weapons or natural attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your mount traveled 40 feet in a round, you would gain a +8 bonus on <a href="../../skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> checks and you and your mount would both gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your caster level. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends.</p>
<h2 id="sanctify-armor">Sanctify Armor</h2>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless, object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless, object)</p>
<p>You imbue your armor with a righteous aura. It gains a +1 enhancement bonus per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). When using your judgment or smite ability, you gain DR 5/evil.</p>
<p>An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.</p>
<h2 id="saving-finale">Saving Finale</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 immediate action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you can immediately end your bardic performance when a creature within range affected by your bardic performance fails a saving throw, allowing the subject to immediately reroll the failed saving throw.</p>
<h2 id="scent-trail">Scent Trail</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a queen ant)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong>one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that only the creatures you designate at the time of casting can detect. These creatures find it very easy to follow this trail. They gain a +20 competence bonus on any <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks made for the purpose of tracking the creature laying this trail. Subject creatures with the scent special ability gain a +10 competence bonus on Wisdom or <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks to follow the trail.</p>
<p>In addition, you can leave scent messages along the trail. Each word or emotion in this message requires spending a move action in the same spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this message must make another DC 20 <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> check, with a -1 penalty for every word or emotion in the message, in order to understand it. Creatures cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot use, or do not have, a sense of smell. Creatures can use this spell to backtrack through a dungeon, maze, or similar areas even if the creature laying down the trail crossed over the spot multiple times.</p>
<h2 id="screech">Screech</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [sonic]; <strong>Level</strong> witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 30 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 30-ft.-radius spread centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You emit a shrill, piercing shriek, startling those around you into dropping their guard. Enemies in the area must make a successful saving throw or immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from foes that threaten them. You and your allies are unaffected by your own <em><a href="#screech">screech</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="sculpt-corpse">Sculpt Corpse</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (lump of wax)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one dead creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>With a clammy caress and a word to the powers lurking beyond death, you can reshape a dead body look like another creature or even a specific person so long as you have first-hand knowledge of how that creature or person actually looks. You can make the corpse one size larger or smaller and change anything else about it including its apparent type, gender, or age. Creatures with a reason to suspect deception may make a Will saving throw to realize that the corpse was altered. If you chose to make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone who knows that individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not actually that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or less they believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled the person they knew rather than a deliberate fake. This spell merely changes the appearance of the corpse. Any spell or effect that targets the corpse (such as <em><a href="../../spells/speakWithDead.html#_speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a></em> or <em><a href="../../spells/raiseDead.html#_raise-dead">raise dead</a></em>) treats it as if it still had its original appearance.</p>
<h2 id="seamantle">Seamantle</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a cup of water)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p>You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle</a></em>, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have <em><a href="../../spells/freedomOfMovement.html#_freedom-of-movement">freedom of movement</a></em> effects. The cover granted by the <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle</a></em> does not enable you to make <a href="../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a> checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as <em><a href="../../spells/cloudkill.html#_cloudkill">cloudkill</a></em>).</p>
<p>The <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle</a></em> blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle</a></em>; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as a bubble of steam contained within the <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle</a></em> rather than its usual effect.</p>
<p>The <em><a href="#seamantle">seamantle</a></em> allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as <em><a href="../../spells/flameBlade.html#_flame-blade">flame blade</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/flamingSphere.html#_flaming-sphere">flaming sphere</a></em>, or <em><a href="../../spells/incendiaryCloud.html#_incendiary-cloud">incendiary cloud</a></em>). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming">flaming</a></em> or <em><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst">flaming burst</a></em> weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.</p>
<h2 id="seek-thoughts">Seek Thoughts</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 3, bard 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a handful of copper coins)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 40 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration, up to 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>Similar to <em><a href="../../spells/detectThoughts.html#_detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a></em>, <em><a href="#seek-thoughts">seek thoughts</a></em> allows you to sift through the surface thoughts of those around you. You may scan for either the answer to a simple question (such as “Where is the hidden lair of the wererats?”) or for information on a general topic (such as the beliefs of an evil cult). You detect the number of creatures who are thinking about this question or topic within range, as well as their location if they are visible to you. <em><a href="#seek-thoughts">Seek thoughts</a></em> does not let you read actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about the topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you from sensing a creature's thoughts for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p>You can maintain concentration on <em><a href="#seek-thoughts">seek thoughts</a></em>while you engage in normal conversation, allowing you to ask leading questions about topics of interest. A creature conversing with you while you concentrate can notice that you are distracted with a successful DC 25 <a href="../../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check.</p>
<h2 id="shadow-projection">Shadow Projection</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>necromancy [evil]; <strong>Level</strong>sorcerer/wizard 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Component</strong>S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 hour/level (D)</p>
<p>With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow (see <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>245). Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect.</p>
<p>While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's <em>create spawn</em>ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own. Your <em><a href="#shadow-projection">shadow projection</a></em> has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.</p>
<p>If your <em><a href="#shadow-projection">shadow projection</a></em> is slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to -1 hit points. Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.</p>
<h2 id="shared-wrath">Shared Wrath</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 4</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong> up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>This spell functions as <em><a href="wrath.html#_wrath">wrath</a></em>, except that you grant multiple creatures the bonuses against your designated foe. All subjects of <em><a href="#shared-wrath">shared wrath</a></em> receive their bonuses against the same creature.</p>
<h2 id="share-language">Share Language</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination; <strong>Level</strong> bard 1, cleric 2, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a page from a dictionary)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You can share your facility for one particular language with another creature. For 24 hours the target can read, understand, and communicate to the best of its ability in any one language which you already know. For every 5 levels you possess, you can grant the use of another language you know, to a maximum of 5 languages at 20th level. The target must have the physical capacity to articulate sounds, make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced vocabulary, the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.</p>
<p>Similarly, this spell does not affect the basic nature of the target, or its disposition toward you or anyone else, so convincing it to actually carry out these instructions could require negotiation, threats, or outright bribery.</p>
<h2 id="share-senses">Share Senses</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination (scrying); <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 full round</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a hair, scale, or feather from your familiar)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> your familiar</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>Spending a moment in meditation and conjuring an image of the creature to mind, you reshape your link with your familiar, causing it to functions like a scrying sensor. Upon casting this spell you can hear, see, or smell (any one, your choice) what your familiar is experiencing. You gain the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities your familiar has tied to the chosen sense (such as low-light vision or scent), but use your own <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> skill. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your familiar, but you must have an active empathic link. You may change the sense you are sharing as a standard action. Unlike other scrying spells, share senses does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, and you are unable to see in magical or natural darkness unless your familiar possesses the ability to see in such conditions.</p>
<p>The sensory link with your familiar can be detected as though it were a scrying sensor.</p>
<h2 id="shifting-sand">Shifting Sand</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [earth]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a handful of sand)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 20-ft. spread</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The <em><a href="#shifting-sand">shifting sand</a></em> obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. <a href="../../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the <em><a href="#shifting-sand">shifting sand</a></em> must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.</p>
<p>As a move action, you may move the area of shifting sand up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spell's area are carried along with the <em><a href="#shifting-sand">shifting sand</a></em> in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the <em><a href="#shifting-sand">shifting sand</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="sift">Sift</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination; <strong>Level</strong> bard 0, inquisitor 0</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 30 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> one 10-ft. cube</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You examine an area at range as if you were searching for fine details with the <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> skill. Make a <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check with a -5 penalty, modified as normal for conditions. No penalty is applied for distance. Apply the result against the DC for any hidden features, such as secret doors, traps, or hidden treasure. You must be able to see the area you are attempting to search, and you only find details that can be perceived with sight or touch. <em><a href="#sift">Sift</a></em> detects only objects and features, not actual creatures.</p>
<h2 id="sirocco">Sirocco</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [air, fire]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (handful of fine sand cast into the air)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> cylinder (20-ft. radius, 60 ft. high)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial, see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>A blast of furnace-hot wind blasts downward, inflicting 4d6 fire damage +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knocking them prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the fire damage and negates being knocked prone. Flying creatures forced into the ground by the powerful downdraft take damage as if they fell unless they make a DC 15 <a href="../../skills/fly.html#_fly">Fly</a> check, in which case they remain at their original altitude. Any creature that takes damage from a sirocco becomes fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous round of exposure to a <em><a href="#sirocco">sirocco</a></em> spell). Creatures with the water subtype take a -4 penalty on all saving throws against this spell and take double normal damage.</p>
<h2 id="sleepwalk">Sleepwalk</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 4, witch 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a sprig of belladonna worth 100 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> unconscious creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but remains helpless for all other purposes. The subject moves at half speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while <em>sleepwalking</em> it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally. While <em><a href="#sleepwalk">sleepwalk</a></em> allows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement.</p>
<h2 id="slipstream">Slipstream</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a few drops of oil and water)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a low-cresting wave of water that carries the target along the surface of water or the ground. When moving across level ground, the target's speed increases by 10 feet. If going downhill, speed increases by 20 feet instead, but <em><a href="#slipstream">slipstream</a></em> provides no movement bonus when going uphill. While swimming, the <em><a href="#slipstream">slipstream</a></em> increases the target's swim speed by 20 feet—if the target does not have a swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft.</p>
<h2 id="snake-staff">Snake Staff</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 5, druid 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a knife suitable for whittling)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> 1 or more pieces of wood, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (object)</p>
<p>With a long hissing whisper, you transform ordinary pieces of wood into various sorts of snakes that immediately attack your foes. As long as the snakes remain within sight, you can direct their actions telepathically as a free action. You can only apply this spell to wooden objects not in a creature's possession or not part of a larger structure or plant. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below. See <a href="../../monsters/snake.html">Snake statistics</a> and advanced and giant <a href="../../monsters/monsterAdvancement.html">simple templates</a>.</p>
<p><em>Venomous Snake</em>: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 1 snake.</p>
<p><em>Constrictor Snake</em>: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 2 snakes.</p>
<p><em>Advanced Venomous Snake</em>: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 2 snakes.</p>
<p><em>Advanced Constrictor Snake</em>: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 3 snakes.</p>
<p><em>Advanced Giant Venomous Snake</em>: A log or pile of debris. Counts as 4 snakes.</p>
<p><em>Advanced Giant Constrictor Snake</em>: A fallen tree or a large pile of debris. Counts as 5 snakes.</p>
<h2 id="solid-note">Solid Note</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> bard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> one solidified musical note</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> concentration + 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang it, suspended, wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as hook, pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance of the <em><a href="#solid-note">solid note</a></em> depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the <em><a href="#solid-note">solid note</a></em> resists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the <em><a href="#solid-note">solid note</a></em> simply fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.</p>
<h2 id="spark">Spark</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [fire]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, witch 0</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V or S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one Fine object</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (object)</p>
<p>You can make an unattended Fine flammable object catch on fire. This works as if you were using flint and steel except that you can use <em><a href="#spark-">spark</a></em> in any sort of weather and it takes much less time to actually ignite an object.</p>
<h2 id="spiked-pit">Spiked Pit</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3</p>
<p>This spell functions as <em><a href="createPit.html#_create-pit-">create pit</a></em>, except that the pit is lined with wickedly sharp spikes along its bottom and walls and has a maximum depth of 50 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal, plus 2d6 points of piercing damage from the spikes. Any creature or object coming into contact with the spikes along the walls, such as a creature trying to climb out, or rope or other typical aids to climbing, takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round they are in contact with the walls. For those willing to accept the damage incurred while climbing, the pit's walls have a <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> DC of 20.</p>
<h2 id="spiritual-ally">Spiritual Ally</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [force]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> spiritual ally of force</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for <em><a href="../../spells/spiritualWeapon.html#_spiritual-weapon">spiritual weapon</a></em>), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.</p>
<p>Each round after the first, you can move the <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/disintegrate.html#_disintegrate">disintegrate</a></em>, a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, or a <em><a href="../../magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation">rod of cancellation</a></em> affects it. A <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em>'s AC against touch attacks is 10.</p>
<p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <em><a href="#spiritual-ally">spiritual ally</a></em> strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>
<h2 id="spite">Spite</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration; <strong>Level</strong> witch 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (rare inks worth 250 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level (D) or until discharged</p>
<p>Choose a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of 1 standard action or less. As part of the action of casting <em><a href="#spite">spite</a></em>, you cast the associated spell and bind it into a defensive ward in the form of a tattoo, birthmark, or wart somewhere upon your body. The next time you are hit by a melee attack or a combat maneuver is used successfully against you, the stored spell is triggered against your foe. You do not need to succeed on a touch attack to affect the target, but in all other respects the spell is treated as though you had cast it normally. If the attacking creature is not a valid target for the spell, the stored spell is lost with no effect.</p>
<p>You can have only one <em><a href="#spite">spite</a></em> spell in effect at a time; if you cast this spell a second time, the previous spell effect ends.</p>
<h2 id="stay-the-hand">Stay the Hand</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 immediate action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level and special; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You cause a creature's arm to waver and prevent it from striking another creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both accuracy and power, taking a -5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally targeted for the duration of the spell.</p>
<h2 id="stone-call">Stone Call</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [earth]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong>cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>A rain of dirt, gravel, and small pebbles fills the area, dealing 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, this debris covers the ground, making the entire area difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the rocks disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).</p>
<h2 id="stone-fist">Stone Fist</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [earth]; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 1, druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a chip of granite)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p>This spell transforms your hands into living stone. While this spell is in effect, your unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity and deal 1d6 points of lethal bludgeoning damage (1d4 if you are Small). In addition, your unarmed strikes ignore the hardness of any object with a hardness less than 8.</p>
<p><em><a href="../../spells/stoneToFlesh.html#_stone-to-flesh">Stone to flesh</a></em> immediately dispels <em><a href="#stone-fist">stone fist</a></em>. Should you be the target of <em><a href="../../spells/transmuteRockToMud.html#_transmute-rock-to-mud">transmute rock to mud</a></em>, this spell immediately ends and you take 4d6 points of damage.</p>
<h2 id="stormbolts">Stormbolts</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [electricity]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 8, druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, witch 8</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a copper rod)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 30 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> a 30-ft.-radius spread, centered on you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, lightning spills forth from your body in all directions. The bolts do not harm natural vegetation or creatures in the area you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creatures within the area take 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and are stunned for 1 round. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun effect.</p>
<h2 id="strong-jaw">Strong Jaw</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 4, ranger 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>Laying a hand upon an allied creature's jaw, claws, tentacles, or other natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creature's natural attacks. Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is. If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creature's size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.</p>
<h2 id="stumble-gap">Stumble Gap</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation); <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, F (miniature shovel costing 10 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> see text</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round + 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a shallow extradimensional hole perfectly sized to trip anyone who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square with a depth of six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you first create the hole, or who later steps into the square containing the hole, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent square and taking 1d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its saving throw still stumbles ever so slightly and takes a -1 penalty on all rolls and checks for 1 round. The spell has no effect on creatures adjacent to the square containing the hole.</p>
<h2 id="stunning-finale">Stunning Finale</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong> up to 3 creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude partial; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, assaulting the senses of the targets with your finale. Each target is stunned for 1 round. On a successful saving throw, a target is staggered for 1 round.</p>
<h2 id="suffocation">Suffocation</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a vial containing a bit of the caster's breath)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 3 rounds</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>This spell extracts the air from the target's lungs, causing swift suffocation. The target can attempt to resist this spell's effects with a Fortitude save—if he succeeds, he is merely staggered for 1 round as he gasps for breath. If the target fails, he immediately begins to suffocate. On the target's next turn, he falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to -1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round, the target can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but the spell effect continues for 3 rounds, and each time a target fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further along the track to suffocation. This spell only affects living creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to defeat the effects of this spell by simply holding one's breath—if the victim fails the</p>

<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature/2 levels (no two of which may be more than 30 feet apart)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell functions as suffocation except as noted above. Note that the duration of this spell is much longer, forcing those suffering from the effect to make far more Fortitude saves to stave off eventual suffocation.</p>
<h2 id="summon-eidolon">Summon Eidolon</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (summoning); <strong>Level</strong> summoner 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a silver coin)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one eidolon</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You open a rift between dimensions that summons your eidolon. Treat this as if you had summoned your eidolon normally, except that it only remains with you for the duration of this spell. While summoned in this way, your eidolon cannot touch any creature warded by <em><a href="../../spells/protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil">protection from evil</a></em> or a similar effect and your eidolon can be sent back to its home plane by <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell while your eidolon is already on your plane, this spell has no effect. This spell allows you to summon your eidolon even if it has been returned to its home plane due to damage.</p>
<h2 id="swarm-skin">Swarm Skin</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 6, witch 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a crushed insect hive)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>see text</p>
<p>You convert all of your soft tissue into swarms of insects or other creatures and send them off to do your bidding, leaving nothing but your bones and gear behind. These swarms have all their normal qualities and abilities but also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows you to perceive what they do and to control their actions. While in this form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms.</p>
<p>Each time you cast this spell you get a total allotment of levels equal to your caster level and any swarm you choose to create costs one or more of those levels. You can “spend” your allotment of levels to create any combination of swarms so long as their total does not exceed your caster level.</p>

<p>Once you create these swarms they remain in existence until destroyed or you order them to return to your body. When all swarms have returned to your body or are destroyed, your flesh wraps itself back around your bones and you regain the ability to act normally. If your bones are not where you left them you must first locate them in order to regain access to your body. You always know if your bones are destroyed and your consciousness remains in control of the swarms until they too are destroyed (and your die). If you can use the swarms to get help and arrange for someone to repair your bones (using anything that would normally restore you to life), at which point you can return the swarms to your body.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-body">Thorn Body</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 3, druid 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p>This spell causes spines to grow from your exposed skin, damaging creatures that strike you. Any creature striking you with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures using melee weapons with reach are unaffected by this spell. Creatures that successfully grapple you take 2d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, your natural attacks and unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage.</p>
<p>Thorns created by this spell persist through any new physical shape or form you assume, such as via wildshape or any polymorph effect.</p>
<h2 id="threefold-aspect">Threefold Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> druid 5, witch 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> S, F (silver crescent worth 5 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 24 hours (D)</p>
<p><em><a href="#threefold-aspect">Threefold aspect</a></em> allows you to shift your appearance between your natural age and three idealized age categories: young adult (youth/maiden), adulthood (father/mother), or elderly (elder/crone). In each case, your appearance is your own at the appropriate age, rather than that of a new individual.</p>
<p>You may change between these three aspects or your actual age as a standard action. As the young adult, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, but suffer a -2 penalty to Wisdom. In the adult aspect, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Dexterity. As the elderly aspect, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. As enhancement bonuses, these stack with any bonuses or penalties you may have from your actual age (which are untyped bonuses)—the bonuses granted by this spell represent your idealized form in this threefold aspect rather than simply duplicating your ability scores at any one particular age.</p>
<p><em><a href="../../spells/trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing">True seeing</a></em> reveals your natural appearance overlaid with that your aspect, recognizing both as part of your true self. Individuals who study you closely and have interacted with you at another apparent age recognize a resemblance (as though family) with a successful DC 20 <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception">Perception</a> check.</p>
<p><em><a href="#threefold-aspect">Threefold aspect</a></em>does not alter your clothing or equipment, and does not heal any deformity or injury unrelated to age.</p>
<h2 id="thundering-drums">Thundering Drums</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [sonic]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> 15 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong>cone-shaped burst</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You strike the ground in front of you, filling the area in front of you with the thunder of pounding drums. Any creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 5d8) and is knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates being knocked prone.</p>
<h2 id="timely-inspiration">Timely Inspiration</h2>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 immediate action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>A word of arcane-empowered inspiration can snatch victory from seeming defeat. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The target gains a +1 competence bonus per five caster levels (maximum +3 bonus) on the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If the bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the roll succeeds.</p>
<h2 id="tireless-pursuers">Tireless Pursuers</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 4, ranger 3</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a hard biscuit broken into pieces)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you plus one touched creature/3 levels</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>This spell functions as <em><a href="tirelessPursuit.html#_tireless-pursuit">tireless pursuit</a></em>, except as noted above.</p>
<h2 id="tireless-pursuit">Tireless Pursuit</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 1, ranger 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a hard biscuit)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
<p>You harden your body against the stresses of long travel. You halve the damage caused by hustling and forced marching (see <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 171). In addition, for the duration of the spell you ignore any fatigue caused by such travel. Once the spell ends, if you still have any nonlethal damage caused by the hustling or forced march, you become fatigued, or exhausted if already fatigued.</p>
<h2 id="touch-of-gracelessness">Touch of Gracelessness</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude partial; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling clown. The target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the target's Dexterity score below 1.</p>
<p>In addition, if the subject moves more than half its speed, it falls prone. If the subject flies, its maneuverability is reduced by one step (perfect maneuverability becomes good, good becomes average, and so on).</p>
<p>A successful Fortitude save halves the penalty to Dexterity and negates the possibility of falling prone or the reduction to fly maneuverabilities.</p>
<h2 id="touch-of-the-sea">Touch of the Sea</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 1, druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>You cause webs to grow between the target's fingers and its feet to transform into flippers, granting a swim speed of 30 feet along with the standard +8 bonus on <a href="../../skills/swim.html#_swim">Swim</a> checks and the ability to take 10 even if distracted or endangered. You can also use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight line. This transformation causes any boots or gloves the target is wearing to meld into its form (although magic items with a continuous effect continue to function). This spell does not grant the target any ability to breathe water.</p>
<h2 id="transmogrify">Transmogrify</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> summoner 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a flask of quicksilver worth 1,000 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> your eidolon</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>Your eidolon's form shifts and transforms. This spell allows you to change any of the eidolon's evolutions by allocating its evolution pool on new evolutions. If you have the aspect or greater aspect ability, this spell also allows you to change the evolution points spent to modify you, including removing or adding points as allowed by those abilities.</p>
<p>Your eidolon cannot benefit from this spell more than once per day. This spell does not allow you to change your eidolon's base form.</p>
<h2 id="transmute-potion-to-poison">Transmute Potion to Poison</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round then 1 minute/level; see text</p>
<p>This extract causes you to take on a pale, sickly pallor for 1 round. During this time, if you consume a potion, it has no effect. Instead, your mouth fills with a vile poison that you can spit onto a weapon as a free action. If you do not spit out the poison in 1 round, it affects you instead. The effect of the poison depends on the level of spell contained in the potion consumed (see below). If the poison is not used within 1 minute per caster level it becomes inert. You can only create one dose of poison in this way per casting of this spell.</p>
<h2 id="transmuted-poisons">Transmuted Poisons</h2>
<p>The following poisons are created through the <em><a href="#transmute-potion-to-poison">transmute potion to poison</a></em> spell. The power of the poison depends on the level of the spell contained in the transmuted potion.</p>
<p><strong>0-Level Potion Poison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> poison, injury; <strong>Save</strong> Fortitude DC 10</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> 1/round for 2 rounds</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> 1 Dex damage; <strong>Cure</strong> 1 save</p>
<p><strong>1st-Level Potion Poison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> poison, injury; <strong>Save</strong> Fortitude DC 11</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> 1/round for 4 rounds</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> 1d2 Dex damage; <strong>Cure</strong> 1 save</p>
<p><strong>2nd-Level Potion Poison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> poison, injury; <strong>Save</strong> Fortitude DC 13</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> 1/round for 6 rounds</p>

<p><strong>3rd-Level Potion Poison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> poison, injury; <strong>Save</strong> Fortitude DC 14</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> 1/round for 6 rounds</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> 1d4 Con damage; <strong>Cure</strong> 2 consecutive saves</p>
<h2 id="treasure-stitching">Treasure Stitching</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 4, cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a piece of embroidered cloth no larger than 10-ft. square worth 100 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Targets</strong> all objects on cloth</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (object)</p>
<p>You can transform all objects placed on a cloth into an embroidered, two-dimensional representation, making it easy for you to store and transport the items. You can pile any amount or weight of objects on the cloth so long as the pile stays within the dimensions of the cloth (up to a 10-foot cube). When you cast the spell the entire pile disappears into the cloth, replaced by a highly accurate, sewn picture of the pile from whatever angle you wish. The cloth retains its normal weight and dimensions. You can restore the pile of objects at any time as a full-round action by unfurling the cloth and ordering the spell to end, consuming the cloth. Anyone else wishing to restore the objects must successfully dispel your spell. If the cloth is destroyed or significantly damaged, all objects held within the cloth are lost. This spell cannot affect artifacts or other sorts of similarly unique objects.</p>
<h2 id="true-form">True Form</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>abjuration; <strong>Level</strong>druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Component</strong>V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>up to one creature/3 levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes</p>
<p><em><a href="#true-form">True form</a></em> removes any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as <em><a href="../../spells/balefulPolymorph.html#_baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a></em> or <em>giant form</em>), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.</p>
<p>A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.</p>
<h2 id="tsunami">Tsunami</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> 10-ft.-deep wave 10 ft. wide/level and 2 ft. tall/level</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 5 rounds</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line across water or land—you select the direction the wave travels (which must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round—on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round.</p>
<p>Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage). In addition, the tsunami makes a special CMB check against any creature it strikes—the wave's CMB is equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or <a href="../../skills/swim.html#_swim">Swim</a> check opposed by the wave's CMB check—if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried along by the wave.</p>
<p>Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space—if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. <em><a href="../../spells/freedomOfMovement.html#_freedom-of-movement">Freedom of movement</a></em> prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.</p>
<p>A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.</p>
<h2 id="twilight-knife">Twilight Knife</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [force]; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, F (a small knife)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> floating knife of force</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You create a darkly sinister floating knife that attacks the same creature as you each round. If you choose not to attack a creature, or you make an attack that affects multiple opponents, the knife makes no attack during that round. The knife uses your base attack bonus modified by either your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher) when making this attack. Unless you specifically will it to do otherwise, or it proves impossible to do so, the knife always maneuvers itself so that it can flank your opponent before making the attack. The knife deals 1d4 points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a normal dagger. In addition, if the target is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the knife can make sneak attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points of force damage per four caster levels on a successful attack.</p>
<p>A <em><a href="#twilight-knife-">twilight knife</a></em> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <em><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>, <em><a href="../../spells/disintegrate.html#_disintegrate">disintegrate</a></em>, a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, or a <em><a href="../../magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation">rod of cancellation</a></em> affects it. A <em><a href="#twilight-knife-">twilight knife</a></em>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object) plus your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <em><a href="#twilight-knife-">twilight knife</a></em> strikes it. If the knife is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>
<h2 id="twin-form">Twin Form</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a blend of soil and the caster's blood)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level or until discharged (D)</p>
<p>This extract splits a perfect double of yourself from your body, dressed and equipped exactly as you are. You are able to shift your consciousness from one body to the other once each round as a free action. This shift takes place either immediately before your turn or immediately after it, but not during the round. You may act normally in the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated as though dazed, except it may take a single move action each round during your turn. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank, make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies.</p>
<p>Both you and your twin have the same statistics and start with the number of hit points you had when you ingested the extract. Once you have split, these hit points are tracked separately. Any spells, extracts, or magical effects (such as from potions) that were active when you ingested the extract are active for both you and your twin. If any such effects expire, are dispelled, dismissed, or otherwise used or ended, they end for both of you. Extracts or spells cast after you split affect you and your twin as though you were two separate targets. Your equipment is linked between your two selves, and if an item on one is consumed or destroyed, its duplicate is used up or destroyed as well.</p>
<p>The body you do not inhabit crumbles into dust when the extract's duration expires or is dismissed. If the body you inhabit is destroyed, you immediately shift to your surviving self and the extract immediately ends. The body you left behind crumbles into dust, and you are stunned until the start of your next turn. If the body you do not inhabit is destroyed, the extract also ends immediately, but you suffer no ill effects.</p>
<p>You have no special ability to sense what your second body is experiencing, though you immediately know if it has been destroyed. You may switch between bodies at any distance on the same plane. If your bodies cross into separate planes (including through the use of <em><a href="../../spells/teleport.html#_teleport">teleport</a></em> or <em><a href="../../spells/blink.html#_blink">blink</a></em>), the body you inhabit survives, while your other body is destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="unfetter">Unfetter</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> summoner 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a broken chain)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> your eidolon</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell breaks the life link between you and your eidolon. This spell allows your eidolon to venture more than 100 feet away from you without penalty. It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect without penalty, but if the spell expires while the eidolon is farther than 100 feet away, it immediately loses hit points as normal for distance and is possibly sent back to its home plane. While this spell is in effect, you cannot sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to your eidolon. Damage that would be transferred due to the life bond ability is not transferred. If you attempt to use the transposition ability while this spell is in effect, you must roll on the <em><a href="../../spells/teleport.html#_teleport">teleport</a></em> mishap table, using the “studied carefully” row.</p>
<h2 id="universal-formula">Universal Formula</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (quicksilver and powdered platinum worth 100 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p>As you ingest this extract, it transforms into the appropriate extract for any formula you know of 3rd level or lower and takes effect immediately. If the chosen formula has an expensive material component, it must be provided along with the component for this formula. You may not create an infused extract with this formula.</p>
<h2 id="unwilling-shield">Unwilling Shield</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> bard 5, inquisitor 5, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (ruby dust worth 250 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>Like <em><a href="../../spells/shieldOther.html#_shield-other">shield other</a></em>, <em><a href="#unwilling-shield">unwilling shield</a></em> creates a mystic connection between you and the target, but unlike <em><a href="../../spells/shieldOther.html#_shield-other">shield other</a></em>, the target shares the wounds that you receive. In addition, the link draws upon the target's life force to supplement your own defenses. You gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as <em>charm</em> effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects are not affected. If you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subject, but damage already split is not assigned to you.</p>
<p>If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell remains active, but damage is no longer shared until you are once again within range of each other.</p>
<h2 id="unwitting-ally">Unwitting Ally</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 0</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You befuddle the target's mind. The target has difficulty telling friend from foe for a short period of time. The subject is considered your ally and not your enemies' ally while determining flanking. The subject takes no other hostile action against your enemies due to this spell's effect.</p>
<h2 id="vanish">Vanish</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong>illusion (glamer); <strong>Level</strong>bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Component</strong>V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>1 round/level (up to 5 rounds) (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong>yes (harmless)</p>
<p>This spell functions like <em><a href="../../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility">invisibility</a>,</em> except the effect only lasts for 1 round per caster level (maximum of 5 rounds). Like <em><a href="../../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility">invisibility</a></em>, the spell immediately ends if the subject attacks any creature.</p>
<h2 id="veil-of-positive-energy">Veil of Positive Energy</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration [good]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal or 5 ft.; see text</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you or all creatures within 5 ft.; see text</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level (D)</p>
<p>You surround yourself with a veil of positive energy, making it harder for undead creatures to harm you. When under the effect of this spell, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and a+2 sacred bonus on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only against attacks or effects created by undead creatures. You can dismiss this spell before its normal duration as a swift action on your turn to deal a number of points of positive energy damage equal to your level to all undead creatures within 5 feet of you.</p>
<h2 id="venomous-bolt">Venomous Bolt</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> ranger 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 swift action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one arrow or bolt</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Fortitude negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You infuse a single arrow or crossbow bolt with natural venom as you fire it. In addition to its normal damage, anyone struck by this arrow or bolt is affected as if by the <em><a href="../../spells/poison.html#_poison">poison</a></em> spell. If the arrow is not fired immediately, the spell ends with no effect.</p>
<h2 id="versatile-weapon">Versatile Weapon</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless, object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless, object)</p>
<p>You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire. This spell functions like <em><a href="../../spells/magicWeapon.html#_magic-weapon-greater">greater magic weapon</a></em>, except that it subtly alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This spell can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.</p>
<h2 id="vomit-swarm">Vomit Swarm</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (summoning); <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 2, witch 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>one swarm of spiders</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p>You vomit forth a <a href="../../monsters/spider.html#_spider-swarm">swarm of spiders</a> that attacks all other creatures within its area. The swarm begins adjacent to you, but if no living creatures are within its area, it moves in one direction of your choosing at its normal speed. You can move the swarm or change the swarm's direction by spending a standard action to concentrate on the swarm, otherwise it continues moving in its current direction. If your caster level is at least 7th, you can vomit forth a swarm of wasps instead. Finally, if your caster level is at least 13th, you can vomit forth a swarm of army ants.</p>
<h2 id="vortex">Vortex</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a stirring spoon)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> whirlpool 50 ft. deep, 30 ft. wide at top, and 5 ft. wide at base</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Reflex negates, see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You create a powerful and immobile whirlpool in any body of liquid large enough to contain the spell's effect. Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be pulled into the whirlpool and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the whirlpool to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish. A boat that is equal in length or shorter than the vortex's width that passes through a vortex takes 6d6 points of damage and is caught up by the current. If the boat's captain makes a DC 25 <a href="../../skills/profession.html#_profession">Profession</a> (sailor) check (or if the boat is longer than the vortex's width), the boat takes only half damage and is not caught up by the vortex.</p>
<h2 id="wake-of-light">Wake of Light</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [good]; <strong>Level</strong> paladin 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> 120 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> a 10-ft.-wide path in a straight line, up to 120 ft. long</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You and your mount lay down a trail of glowing, heavenly mist behind you as you move that makes passage easier for good creatures but more difficult for evil creatures. This glowing trail of mist appears behind your mount in a straight line starting where you cast the spell and ending where your mount ends its movement. The mist takes the form of a path 10 feet wide and up to 120 feet long and always floats just above the ground, up to a height of 1 foot. Thereafter, the mist persists for 1 round per level.</p>
<p>Good creatures may walk along the top of the mist as if it were solid, treating squares of difficult terrain containing the mist as normal terrain. Evil creatures find the mist thick and cloying, and treat squares of normal terrain containing the mist as difficult terrain instead. Neutral creatures pass through the mist with no effect. The mist has no effect on obstacles or otherwise impassable terrain, and does not block sight or provide concealment.</p>
<p>Except for very special circumstances (such as a celestial or fiendish mount), mounts use the alignment of their rider when determining how this spell affects them. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends, although the mist remains for the spell's normal duration.</p>
<p>A wake of light cannot follow across water, underwater, or through the air in the case of a mount capable of walking on water, swimming, or flight.</p>
<h2 id="wall-of-lava">Wall of Lava</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> conjuration (creation) [earth, fire]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M/DF (a chunk of dried lava)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> lava wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell creates a vertical <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a>'s</em> maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em>, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).</p>
<p>A creature can move through a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check—failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> also radiates heat as if it were a <em><a href="../../spells/wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire">wall of fire</a></em>, although the heat from a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> radiates from both sides.</p>
<p>Once per round as a move action, you can direct the <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.</p>
<p>All damage inflicted by physical contact with a <em><a href="#wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a></em> continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>
<h2 id="wall-of-suppression">Wall of Suppression</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 9</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (powdered adamantine worth 1,000 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> anti-magic wall occupying up to two 5 ft. cubes/level (S)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>You create a wall of glittering motes that suppresses or even negates any magical effect passing through it. The wall appears to have no actual substance and does not physically obstruct or impede anything attempting to move through it. However, the wall exerts a powerful anti-magical effect. Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1 round per level. Spells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature's ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.</p>
<p>The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the <em><a href="#wall-of-suppression-">wall of suppression</a></em>. The wall does not affect artifacts, anything stemming from the direct action of a deity, or similarly powerful sorts of magic.</p>
<h2 id="wandering-star-motes">Wandering Star Motes</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> illusion (pattern) [light, mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a sprinkle of flash powder)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature and special; see text</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>Will negates; see text; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the <em><a href="#wandering-star-motes">wandering star motes</a></em> jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the <em><a href="#wandering-star-motes">wandering star motes</a></em> jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet. A given creature can only be affected by the <em><a href="#wandering-star-motes">wandering star motes</a></em> once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.</p>
<h2 id="ward-the-faithful">Ward the Faithful</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> abjuration; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>All creatures within the area who worship the same god as you gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saves. At 12th level, these bonuses increase to +3. At 18th level, the bonuses increase to +4.</p>
<p>If you do not worship a specific deity, the bonuses apply to those who share your faith. If you do not have a specific faith or religion, the spell provides benefits only to yourself. Enemies gain the benefits of this spell if they worship the same god or share the same faith as you, even if you view them as heretical.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-of-awe">Weapon of Awe</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> weapon touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless, object); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless, object)</p>
<p>You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no saving throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.</p>
<p>You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.</p>
<h2 id="winds-of-vengeance">Winds of Vengeance</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [air]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 9, druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p>You surround yourself with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, tornado-force winds. These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed. The winds shield you from any other wind effects, and form a shell of breathable air around you, allowing you to fly and breathe underwater or in outer space. Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons) passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds.</p>
<p>In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (if on the ground). On a failed save, Huge flying creatures are checked and Large-sized or smaller flying creatures are blown away instead of knocked prone. On a successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not knocked prone (or checked or blown away).</p>
<h2 id="world-wave">World Wave</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation [earth, water]; <strong>Level</strong> druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> see text</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong> see text</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text (D)</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.</p>
<p>When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell). The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).</p>
<p>You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.</p>
<h2 id="wrathful-mantle">Wrathful Mantle</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> evocation [force, light]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3, paladin 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, DF</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> touch or 5 ft.; see text</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched or all creatures within 5 ft.; see text</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>
<p>A shimmering mantle of light shrouds the subject, casting light like a torch. The subject of the spell gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). The subject can end the <em><a href="#wrathful-mantle">wrathful mantle</a></em> at any time as a swift action to deal 2d8 points of force damage to all creatures within 5 feet.</p>
<h2 id="wrath">Wrath</h2>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <strong>Level</strong> inquisitor 1</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (a thorny vine)</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> personal</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> you</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You focus your anger against an enemy. Choose one enemy creature that you can see. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against that designated creature for every three caster levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster level checks made to overcome the creature's spell resistance, if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits of the <a href="../../feats.html#_improved-critical">Improved Critical</a> feat on attack rolls made against the designated creature. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.</p>

<p>Beyond well-known magic items, from ubiquitous <em>potions of <a href="../spells/cureLightWounds.html#_cure-light-wounds">cure light wounds</a></em>to prized relics like <em><a href="../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-holy">holy</a> avengers</em>, stretch troves of legendary treasures, rare masterworks discovered in the depths of the deadliest dungeons or groundbreaking discoveries crafted by geniuses and madmen. This chapter reaches past the familiar items of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, revealing a wealth of magical masterpieces, some long renowned, others entirely new. GMs who wish to incorporate these new magical items should feel free to make these treasures just as pervasive and fundamental elements of their campaigns as those in the <em>Core Rulebook.</em></p>
<p>With the exception of potions, scrolls, and wands, all the various types of magic items are presented in this chapter. The new spells presented in Chapter 5 are just as likely to be found brewed into potions, written upon scrolls, or empowering wands as those in the <em>Core Rulebook,</em> and might be discovered as such items following the same rules detailed in Chapter 15 of that book.</p>
<h1 id="magic-item-descriptions">Magic Item Descriptions</h1>
<p>The following descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item's effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature's Dexterity modifier in place of the –5 penalty.</p>
<p>Each of the following topics is covered in notational form as part of an item's description.</p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong>: Most of the time, a <em><a href="../spells/detectMagic.html#_detect-magic">detect magic</a></em> spell reveals the school of magic associated with the magic item and the strength of the aura that the item emits. See the <em><a href="../spells/detectMagic.html#_detect-magic">detect magic</a></em> spell description for details.</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level (CL)</strong>: An item's caster level indicates its relative power. It also determines the item's saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the item's powers (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a <em><a href="../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em> spell or similar situation.</p>
<p>The creator's caster level must be as high as the item's caster level (and additional requirements may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator's level).</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong>: Most magic items can only be utilized if worn or wielded in their proper slots. If the item is stowed or placed elsewhere, it does not function. If the slot is listed as “none,” the item functions while in the character's possession.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: This amount is the cost, in gold pieces, to purchase the item, if it is available for sale. Generally speaking, magic items can be sold by PCs for half this value.</p>
<p><strong>Weight</strong>: This figure is the weight of the item. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This section of a magic item describes the item's powers and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong>: With the exception of artifacts, most magic items can be built by a spellcaster with the appropriate feats and prerequisites. This section describes the requirements for and cost of creating a magic item.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous prerequisites such as level, alignment, and race or kind.</p>
<p>A required spell may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a spontaneous caster), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a requirement.</p>
<p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the requirements. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p>
<p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator's level must be known.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: This figure is the cost in gold pieces to create the item. Generally this cost is equal to half the price of an item, but additional material components might increase this number. The cost to create the item includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.</p>
<h1 id="new-magic-items-in-a-campaign">New Magic Items in a Campaign</h1>
<p>How pervasive a GM chooses to make the magic items in this chapter is entirely a matter of personal preference. There's no reason these new items need to be any rarer than those found in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, and they can be integrated into a campaign just as easily. Alternatively, GMs interested in adding an unexpected element to their next encounter or treasure hoard might easily incorporate the properties and specific treasures presented here. As players tend to leaf through the magic item chapter of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>when outfitting their characters, many become quite familiar with the treasures and effects therein. Thus, incorporating any of the following items—especially those that draw upon features first presented elsewhere in this book, like new metamagic rods—allows a GM to surprise and intrigue even the most experienced players.</p>

<p>A shield or suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Armor Of Insults</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate enchantment; <strong>CL</strong> 7th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> armor; <strong>Price</strong> 16,175 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 20 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Each metal bit of this suit of <em>+1 studded leather</em> looks more like a tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language.</p>

It allows the wearer to continually utilize the effects of the spell <em><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/waterWalk.html#_water-walk">water walk</a></em>.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of <em>+1 full plate</em>, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored.</p>

<p>Every inch of this suit of <em>+1 banded mail</em> bears a defaced holy symbol or a design equally offensive to one or more gods and their servants. The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity. The wearer gains SR 19 against any divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (such as a domain granted power or ability from an outsider serving a deity), and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as +2 higher against creatures with these abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This drooping, many-folded suit of <em>+3 hide armor</em> is made from the tanned skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the wearer can grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if using <em><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/giantForm.html#_giant-form-i">giant form I</a></em> (ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost giant) or <em><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/giantForm.html#_giant-form-ii">giant form II</a></em> (cloud giant or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and ends when the wearer commands. Most good folk consider wearing the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or +4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as the attacker.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The fine links of this <em>+1 chain shirt</em> form a pattern of roiling clouds. On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance). This mist moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or destroy it cause the armor to reform into its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking the command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't function (such as underwater). If the character tries to don another suit of armor while the <em>mistmail</em>is in fog form, it reforms at the character's feet.</p>

<p><strong>Slot</strong> armor; <strong>Price</strong> 10,300 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 40 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 chainmail</em> is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a <em>soothsayer's raiment (battlecry)</em> is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.</p>
<p>For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as <em><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/augury.html#_augury">augury</a></em> and <em><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/divination.html#_divination">divination</a></em>), the wearer's chance increases by +5.</p>

<p><strong>Slot</strong> shield; <strong>Price</strong> 16,180 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 45 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Once per day on command, this <em>+2 tower <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield">shield</a></em> can transform into a solid, 10-foot by 10-foot by 1-foot wall of masonry with a battlement on top and an arrow slit in each 5-foot length. The wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC of 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The shield remains in wall form until destroyed or commanded to return to shield form. The wall cannot appear in a space too small to accommodate it.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The wearer of this <em>+1 tower <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield">shield</a></em> may, as a full-round action, transform the shield into a 1-inch thick cube of iron that springs into being around him, completely enclosing his space. The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the cube, including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the cube is dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. Otherwise, the cube reverts to shield form upon command, if the wearer moves from his current space, or the wearer falls unconscious or dies.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This blade seems and behaves in all ways as a <em><a href="#sword-of-subtlety">sword of subtlety</a></em> until actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it imposes a -10 penalty on all <a href="#stealth">Stealth</a> checks made by its wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to tell a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting out the truth or taking some other involuntary action that spoils his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending magic can rid the wielder of the sword once its curse activates.</p>

<p><strong>Cannibal Ring</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 16th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This simple and unadorned copper ring appears slightly tarnished, but seemingly wards off the effects of hunger or other sorts of deprivation; all tests reveal it to be a <em><a href="#ring-of-sustenance">ring of sustenance</a></em>. However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher).</p>
<p>Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst—on any day he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be removed until the curse is broken.</p>

<p><strong>Cloak of Immolation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong evocation; <strong>CL</strong> 12th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> shoulders; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This cloak appears to be a finely made normal garment that radiates protective magic. The cloak can be handled or examined without harm, but when it is put on, it immediately bursts into flames that burn continuously but do not harm the cloak, only its wearer. The cloak deals 1d6 points of fire damage each round and cannot be removed unless the curse is broken. Sufficient amounts of water or other smothering materials can douse the flames temporarily, but the cloak reignites when exposed to air again. Spells like <em><a href="#resist-energy">resist energy</a></em>, <em><a href="#protection-from-energy">protection from energy</a></em>, and similar effects can protect the wearer against the cloak's flames while they last.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone. When a wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes dark like the waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind. The saving throw must be made each round that the crown is worn until the wearer succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet requires breaking the curse. The blindness can be cured using <em><a href="#remove-blindness-deafness">remove blindness/deafness</a></em> or any spell normally used to end a curse.</p>

<p><strong>Gravesoul Armor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate enchantment; <strong>CL</strong> 10th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> armor; <strong>Weight</strong> 20 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This armor behaves in all ways as if it were <em>+1 <a href="#armor-undead-controlling">undead controlling</a> studded leather</em> until its owner actually attempts to use its special property. At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a 20-foot radius must each make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampire) or choose which sorts of undead the affected creatures believe themselves to be, customizing to the personality and abilities of each creature. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves—“zombies” mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite victims on the neck, and so on—but gain none of the special abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm “their” type of undead, so “vampires” avoid garlic, “wraiths” recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures otherwise continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but “their” type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures affected by <em>gravesoul armor</em>.</p>
<p>This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still <em>+1 studded leather</em>, and some characters may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike most cursed items, this one is easily discarded without any magical assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Hat of Hatreds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate illusion; <strong>CL</strong> 10th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> head; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This hat performs in all ways like a <em><a href="#hat-of-disguise">hat of disguise</a></em> until its owner attempts to use it to disguise himself in the presence of a hostile creature. Once he does, the hat causes him to assume the guise of the creature or person the hostile creature most wants to harm. The hat never causes the wearer to assume the appearance of someone the viewer wouldn't harm if he had the opportunity (for example, the greatly feared leader of the local temple).</p>
<p>Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some crime.</p>
<p>Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.</p>

<p><strong>Slot</strong> belt; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a person of the opposite gender. The character's abilities, mind, and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's sex changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item actually removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is permanent unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic takes effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be affected by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of this type can cause another transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Planar Invasion Shield</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong conjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 17th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> shield; <strong>Weight</strong> 15 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This impressive shield seems to be and behaves in all ways as an <em><a href="#absorbing-shield">absorbing shield</a></em> until its owner attempts to use its disintegration power in combat. Once he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating from the battle by the safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the summon monster spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration.</p>
<p>Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an <em><a href="#absorbing-shield">absorbing shield</a></em> and allows its wearer to abandon it.</p>

<p><strong>One-Way Window</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint divination; <strong>CL</strong>5th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb. (20 lbs. in larger form)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This small, 6-inch-square glass tablet grows to a 6-foot-by-3-foot window if placed on any sufficiently large vertical surface and returns to its original size if removed. The window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane of glass. On command, the front of this glass displays all activities on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does not reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it, allowing observers to study them at their leisure.</p>
<p>However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence—enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way window; however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror accurately and can read their thoughts as if using <em><a href="#detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a></em>. Furthermore, the image shown to those using the mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching can see them as well. Once the curse activates, the owner comes to regard using the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic (after all, it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever possible until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence (anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he wasn't the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this desire to continue using it).</p>

<p>Deceptively pleasant looking, a <em>ring of truth</em> bears images of childlike angels and broadly smiling divine creatures holding onto links of a heavy chain. The wearer of this cursed ring is rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not to communicate, but even then must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw to avoid answering a direct question truthfully. The wearer cannot remove the ring unless the magic of the curse is negated.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all ways like any other kind of magical pipes until its owner plays it in an urban setting. Once he does, it requires all people within hearing to make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid falling into a murderous fury. Those who fail their saves gain the effects of a <em><a href="#rage">rage</a></em> spell for the next 1d6 hours and experience a strong compulsion (Will DC 15 negates) to attack any stranger or disliked person whom they encounter during this time. If the owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in an urban setting, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw each day to avoid playing the <em>riot pipes</em> at some point during each subsequent day. The pipes remain with the player until the curse is broken.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>All tests indicate that this hollow metal tube is a <em><a href="#rod-of-flame-extinguishing">rod of flame extinguishing</a></em> until its owner uses it to extinguish or suppress a fire in a combat or other sort of dangerous situation. Once he does, he discovers that rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter his body. This flame persists inside of him for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving him the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, he feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using whatever means at his disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, he takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within him surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, he must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if he saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops harming him, and he can interact normally with the flammable target thereafter.</p>
<p>Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid using it to extinguish or suppress any fire he encounters which he himself did not start. He cannot use the rod against fires that he personally started. Successful curse-breaking magic allows the wielder to get rid of the rod and harmlessly dissipates any fire persisting inside him from the action of the rod.</p>

<p><strong>Bottle of the Bound</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong abjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 4 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Bottle of the Bound</em> is an ancient brass bottle with a narrow neck and a rounded belly, slightly flattened on the bottom so it stands upright when resting on a table. The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants still bound.</p>
<p>A would-be wielder of the <em>Bottle of the Bound</em> must know three secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a <em><a href="#summon-monster-ix">summon monster IX</a></em> spell at will, except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures' destruction or return.</p>
<p>No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to use the <em>Bottle of the Bound</em> have been lost for uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or two of them.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Bottle of the Bound</em> can only be destroyed if every creature bound within is slain or banished, and the empty container is then smashed with a <em><a href="#weapons-holy">holy</a></em> weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Castle Of The Storm King</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong (all schools); <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of—or unable to tap into—its fantastic power.</p>
<p>This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures.</p>
<p>Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the cloud castle has had several masters since he mysteriously disappeared over a thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm King ascended to godhood, while others believe he was captured and imprisoned by a rival, a demon lord, or even a deity wishing to remove a threat, which may mean that the Storm King will one day return to reclaim his castle.</p>
<p>In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the <a href="#leadership">Leadership</a> feat and 17 ranks in <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can only view places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the <a href="#fly">Fly</a> skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a <a href="#fly">Fly</a> check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has been known to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities:</p>
<p><em>• <a href="#call-lightning-storm">Call lightning storm</a></em> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="#guards-and-wards">Guards and wards</a></em> 1/day on the central tower.</li>
<li><em><a href="#storm-of-vengeance">Storm of vengeance</a></em> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).</li>
<li><em><a href="#wind-wall">Wind wall</a></em> at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Cloud Castle of the Storm King</em> can only be destroyed if it is dissipated by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can dissipate it are found only in the most turbulent reaches of the Plane of Air (of course, as nobody knows how to make it travel between planes, those wishing to destroy it must find it on the Plane of Air to have any chance to do so). Any other attacks may cause walls to collapse or even side towers to break loose, but the central chamber and the floors beneath it will continue to exist in a ruined form over a smaller storm cloud as long as this destruction condition is not met.</p>
<p><strong>Fork of the Forgotten One</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+5 <a href="#weapons-flaming">flaming</a> <a href="#wounding">wounding</a> <a href="#unholy">unholy</a> ranseur</em> was once the weapon of a powerful archdevil who they say controlled an entire layer of Hell. When he attempted to defy the Prince of Darkness, he was overthrown and banished into some cold and remote prison at the edge of the multiverse. Still bearing some infernal vestige of the forgotten fiend's power, the fork grants the bearer a +10 bonus on <a href="#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> and <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks and the power to use <em><a href="#scorching-ray">scorching ray</a></em> three times per day.</p>
<p>Any nonevil creature who touches the <em>Fork of the Forgotten One</em> is given a choice: become lawful evil immediately, or die. Those who choose death are instantly slain (Fortitude DC 30 negates). Those who choose to become lawful evil change alignment immediately (no saving throw) and are subject to a <em><a href="#demand">demand</a></em> spell (Will DC 25) requiring that they find the Forgotten One and free him from his icy prison—presumably thereafter he will press them into service for his plans of revenge against those who imprisoned him.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Fork of the Forgotten One</em> is destroyed when a paladin of 19th level or higher touches it and chooses death rather than becoming lawful evil. This sacrifice still kills the paladin, though she can be raised from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>The Moaning Diamond</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> overwhelming transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 4 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Moaning Diamond</em> appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning, as if wailing in pain. Despite the disturbing noise, the <em>Moaning Diamond</em> is not evil. Three times per day, the bearer can call upon its power to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell <em><a href="#stone-shape">stone shape</a></em>, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. Once per day the <em>Moaning Diamond</em> can also summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain; only one such elemental can be summoned at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Moaning Diamond</em> can be smashed by the combined power of three elemental princes, one each from the Planes of Air, Fire, and Water. Even then, the dust must be cast into a place where it will never fall upon stone.</p>
<p><strong>The Shield of the Sun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong abjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+5 large <a href="#shield">shield</a></em>, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have, even from paladin class levels. The <em><a href="#shield">Shield</a> of the Sun</em> also grants its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid).</p>
<p>A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the <em><a href="#shield">Shield</a> of the Sun</em>. The negative levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <em><a href="#restoration">restoration</a></em> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em><a href="#shield">Shield</a> of the Sun</em> may be destroyed if a good-aligned character casts it into the Well of Eternal Night, its light fading into the inky depths before it finally disappears. If a nongood character does the deed, the shield is not destroyed, merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover it.</p>

<p><strong>Beacon of True Faith</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong (all schools); <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The <em>beacon of true faith</em> takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. The torch holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of especially strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. All of these are command-word activated.</p>
<p>Chaotic (violet flame): <em><a href="#word-of-chaos">Word of chaos</a></em> once per day on command.</p>
<p>Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of <em><a href="#protection-from-evil">protection from evil</a></em> and <em><a href="#heroism">heroism</a></em>.</p>
<p>Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of <em><a href="#protection-from-good">protection from good</a></em> and may use <em><a href="#harm">harm</a></em> twice per day.</p>
<p>Lawful (golden flame): <em><a href="#dictum">Dictum</a></em> once per day on command.</p>

<p><strong>Hammer of Thunderbolts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 15 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+3 Large <a href="#weapons-returning">returning</a> warhammer</em> deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a <em><a href="#belt-of-giant-strength">belt of giant strength</a></em> and knows the weapon is a <em>hammer of thunderbolts</em> (not just the <em>+3 warhammer</em> it appears to be), it becomes a <em>+5 Large giant-bane <a href="#weapons-returning">returning</a> <a href="#thundering">thundering</a> warhammer</em> with the following two properties. One, when the bearer hits with the hammer as a thrown attack, it emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's range increment increases to 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>A <em>hammer of thunderbolts</em> is destroyed if heated in a fire giant's forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes the iron of the <em>hammer</em> to become so brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike. Only bathing it in a fire giant's blood can reverse its brittleness; once shattered, nothing can do so.</p>
<p><strong>Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong (all schools); <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the <em>knucklebone's</em> true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the <em>knucklebone of fickle fortune</em> looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see Table 7-13). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.</p>

<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>knucklebone of fickle fortune</em> disappears if its Eha-Zah face (a 20 on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some sages believe that this does not destroy the artifact, and it instead reappears at some random spot in the world, but such knowledge is purely conjecture, for it is not known whether anyone has accomplished this improbable task.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Golden Lute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 3 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The <em>perfect golden lute</em> is said to be a flawless instrument; its tone and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine it practically performs itself, granting anyone who plays it a +10 competency bonus on <a href="#perform">Perform</a> (string instruments) checks with it. A character with ranks in <a href="#perform">Perform</a> (string instrument) can play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or fascinate (as the bardic performance abilities) as if he were a 1st-level bard, performing a number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier. If the user of the <em>perfect golden lute</em> is a bard, he adds +2 to the DC of all bardic performance abilities using the lute, and can use bardic performance with the lute for an additional 6 rounds per day.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>perfect golden lute</em> shatters into splinters if a day passes in which no music is played within 1,000 miles of it, or if its bearer is killed by a bard spell or bardic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Spindle of Perfect <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The <em>spindle of perfect knowledge</em> is large, bright, and flawless marquise-cut diamond <em><a href="#ioun-stones">ioun stone</a></em> the size of a halfling's fist. The gemstone would be a treasure in itself if it lacked magic, but it is also a powerful <em><a href="#ioun-stones">ioun stone</a></em>. The <em>spindle of perfect knowledge</em> functions like a <em><a href="#headband-of-mental-superiority">headband of mental superiority</a></em> +4 and grants 5 ranks in two random <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skills. The wearer can communicate and understand languages as if using <em><a href="#comprehend-languages">comprehend languages</a></em>, <em><a href="#tongues">tongues</a></em>, and telepathy with a range of 100 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The <em>spindle of perfect knowledge</em> is destroyed if worn by a mindless creature for an entire year.</p>
<p><strong>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong conjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 20th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>A <em>talisman of reluctant wishes</em> appears the same as a <em>stone of controlling earth elementals</em>, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a <em>talisman of reluctant wishes</em> must make a DC 15 Charisma check.</p>
<p>If the check fails, the talisman acts as a <em><a href="#stone-of-weight">stone of weight</a></em>. Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.</p>
<p>If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em> is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.</p>
<p>If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like.</p>
<p>The artifact grants one <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em> for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)</p>
<p>Regardless of which reaction results, a <em>talisman of reluctant wishes</em> disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>A <em>talisman of reluctant wishes</em> can be destroyed by wishing it so, using either one of the stone's <em>wishes</em> or a <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em> spell from another source. The stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points of damage to the holder.</p>

<p>These rings follow the normal rules for magic rings as described in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dungeon Ring</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate divination; <strong>CL</strong> 8th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 16,000 gp (<em>jailer's ring</em>), 250 gp (<em>prisoner's ring</em>); <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>A <em>jailer's <a href="#dungeon-ring">dungeon ring</a></em> is worked gold, set with a carnelian. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron <em>prisoner's dungeon rings</em>. When the wearer of a <em>jailer's ring</em> places a <em>prisoner's ring</em> on a subject, the prisoner cannot remove the ring without the use of a <em><a href="#remove-curse">remove curse</a></em>, <em><a href="#limited-wish">limited wish</a></em>, <em><a href="#miracle">miracle</a></em>, or <em><a href="#wish">wish</a></em> spell. The wearer of the <em>jailer's ring</em> can also remove a linked <em>prisoner's ring</em> at any time.</p>
<p>The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked <em>prisoner's ring</em> like a constant <em><a href="#status">status</a></em> spell. Additionally, all wearers of linked <em>prisoner's rings</em> count as familiar to the jailer for purposes of spells such as <em><a href="#scrying">scrying</a></em> and <em><a href="#teleport">teleport</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#forge-ring">Forge Ring</a>, <em><a href="#scrying">scrying</a></em>, <em><a href="#status">status</a></em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 8,000 gp (<em>jailer's ring</em>), 125 gp (<em>prisoner's ring</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ring of Arcane Signets</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint universal; <strong>CL</strong> 1st</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 1,000 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The amorphous, approximately 1-inch-square chunk of rosy crystal that dominates this otherwise plain copper ring forms itself into a specific rune, sigil, or similar identifying marker each time a person first puts it on. If the wearer expects this to occur, he can cause the crystal to adopt any shape he wishes. If the wearer does not expect this to occur, the crystal instead molds itself into an image that symbolizes the wearer or some dominant facet of his personality. Once the crystal assumes this initial form, it always does so whenever the wearer puts on the ring. The wearer can, as a standard action, embed this image on any object (as if using <em><a href="#arcane-mark">arcane mark</a></em>) simply by pressing the ring against it. The wearer may choose the color and other cosmetic features of the image each time he uses the ring. The brand is otherwise permanent unless removed by <em><a href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a></em>, <em><a href="#erase">erase</a></em>, or a more powerful spell.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#forge-ring">Forge Ring</a>, <em><a href="#arcane-mark">arcane mark</a></em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 500 gp</p>
<p><strong>Ring of Delayed Doom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate conjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 9th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 45,000 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This band has nine garnets embedded along its exterior. Whenever the wearer's mind or body first becomes subject to any harmful effect that allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he may, as an immediate action, choose to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute, after he fails the saving throw but before its effects occur. This activation causes one of the garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed, for example, <em><a href="#neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a></em> cast on the wearer while he delays the effect of a poisonous bite removes the poison effect.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#forge-ring">Forge Ring</a>, <em><a href="#heal">heal</a></em>, <em><a href="#time-stop">time stop</a></em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 22,500 gp</p>
<p><strong>Ring of Forcefangs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate evocation; <strong>CL</strong> 9th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 8,000 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This band negates any force spell or spell-like ability targeted at the wearer. Doing so gives the ring a number of charges equal to the spell level of the incoming force effect. The ring can hold a maximum of nine charges. If an incoming force attack would charge the ring beyond this limit, the ring does not negate the attack or gain charges, and the attack affects the wearer normally. On command, the wearer can use the ring's charges to cast <em><a href="#magic-missile">magic missile</a></em>, unleashing one missile (1d4+1 force damage) per charge but no more than five missiles per round.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#forge-ring">Forge Ring</a>, <a href="#heighten-spell">Heighten Spell</a>, <em><a href="#magic-missile">magic missile</a></em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 4,000 gp</p>
<p><strong>Ring of Maniacal Devices</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 3rd</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 5,000 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This deceptively precious looking ring grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on all <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (traps) and <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks. Even if he has no ranks in these skills, the wearer may make <a href="#craft">Craft</a> (traps) and <a href="#disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks as if he were trained in them.</p>

<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 15,000 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Once per day, the wearer of this charred bone ring may, as an immediate action, cause it to detonate in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). If the wearer is killed by the detonation, all magical equipment he carries must also save or take fire damage, and all nonmagical equipment takes this damage with no saving throw. This explosion never destroys the ring.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#forge-ring">Forge Ring</a>, <a href="#quicken-spell">Quicken Spell</a>, <em><a href="#fireball">fireball</a></em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 7,500 gp</p>
<p><strong>Ring of Revelation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint or moderate varied; <strong>CL</strong> 5th (lesser), 7th (greater), or 11th (superior)</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> ring; <strong>Price</strong> 10,000 gp (lesser), 16,000 gp (greater), 24,000 gp (superior); <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>A <em><a href="#ring-of-revelation">ring of revelation</a></em> is a divine item attuned to a particular oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the ring, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any) of the revelation itself; for example, a <em><a href="#ring-of-revelation">ring of revelation</a></em>(combat healer) is only usable by an oracle of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the oracle already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.</p>
<p>A <em>lesser <a href="#ring-of-revelation">ring of revelation</a></em> contains a revelation that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th level. A <em>greater <a href="#ring-of-revelation">ring of revelation</a></em> contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 7th level or higher. A <em>superior <a href="#ring-of-revelation">ring of revelation</a></em> contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 11th level or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#forge-ring">Forge Ring</a>, creator must be an oracle with the desired revelation; <strong>Cost</strong> 5,000 gp (lesser), 8,000 gp (greater), 12,000 gp (superior)</p>

<p>Rods are scepter-like devices that have unique magical powers and do not usually have charges. Many have unique control over the flow of magic. Anyone can use a rod (though metamagic rods have no effect when used by creatures that cannot cast spells). Normal metamagic rods can be used with spells of 6th level or lower. Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th level or lower.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Reroll if you get a duplicate special ability, an ability incompatible with an ability that you've already rolled, or if the extra ability puts you over the +10 limit. A weapon's enhancement bonus and special ability bonus equivilents can't total more than +10.</p>
<p>A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Allying</strong>: An <em><a href="#allying">allying</a> weapon</em> allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to one weapon being used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her weapon's enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally's weapon lasts until the <em><a href="#allying">allying</a> weapon</em>'s wielder's next turn. The enhancement bonus from the <em><a href="#allying">allying</a> weapon</em> does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the ally's weapon (if any).</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#magic-weapon">magic weapon</a></em>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Conductive</strong>: A conductive weapon is able to channel the energy of a spell-like or supernatural ability that relies on a melee or ranged touch attack to hit its target (such as from a cleric's domain granted power, sorcerer's bloodline power, oracle's mystery revelation, or wizard's arcane school power). When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel it through the weapon to the struck opponent, who takes the effects of the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has unlimited uses of a special ability, he may channel through the weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her <em><a href="#conductive">conductive</a> greatsword</em>can expend two uses of lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal greatsword damage and damage from one use of her lay on hands. This weapon property can only be used once per round, and only works with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon (melee or ranged).</p>

<p><strong>Corrosive</strong>: Upon command, a <em><a href="#corrosive">corrosive</a> weapon</em> becomes slick with acid that deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given.</p>
<p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#acid-arrow">acid arrow</a></em>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Corrosive Burst</strong>: A corrosive burst weapon functions as a corrosive weapon that explodes with acid upon striking a successful critical hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra acid damage from the corrosive ability, a <em><a href="#corrosive-burst">corrosive burst</a> weapon</em> deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical modifier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of acid damage instead, and if the modifier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.</p>
<p>Even if the <em><a href="#corrosive">corrosive</a></em>ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra acid damage on a successful critical hit.</p>

<p><strong>Cunning</strong>: This special ability allows a weapon to find chinks in a foe's defenses using the wielder's knowledge of the target. Whenever the weapon's attack is a critical threat, the wielder gains a +2 bonus on the confirmation roll if she has 5 or more ranks in the <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill related to the target's creature type (such as <a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a> [planes] for an outsider opponent).</p>

<p><strong>Dueling</strong>: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A dueling weapon (which must be a weapon that can be used with the <a href="#weapon-finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> feat) gives the wielder a +4 enhancement bonus on initiative checks, provided the weapon is drawn and in hand when the Initiative check is made. It provides a +2 bonus on disarm checks and feint checks, a +2 bonus to CMD to resist disarm attempts, and a +2 to the DC to perform a feint against the wielder.</p>
<p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#cat-s-grace">cat's grace</a></em>; Price +14,000 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Furious</strong>: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A <em><a href="#furious">furious</a> weapon</em> serves as a focus for its wielder's anger. When the wielder is raging or under the effect of a <em><a href="#rage">rage</a></em> spell, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than normal. If the wielder has a rage power that gives a skill bonus while raging (such as raging climber, raging leaper, or raging swimmer), the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill whenever the weapon is wielded or held in hand, even when not raging; this bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon (including the +2 when the wielder is raging).</p>
<p>Moderate enchantment (compulsion); CL 8th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, rage; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Grayflame</strong>: This weapon responds to channeled positive or negative energy. When the wielder spends a swift action to channel energy through the weapon, it ignites with a strange gray flame that sheds light as a torch, increases the weapon's enhancement bonus by +1, and deals +1d6 damage (as the divine power from <em><a href="#flame-strike">flame strike</a></em>) to creatures struck by the weapon. This flame lasts for 1 round for every d6 damage or healing the channeling normally provides. When charged with positive energy, the flame is a silvery gray, good creatures are immune to the weapon's extra damage, and the weapon counts as a good and silver weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. When charged with negative energy, the flame is an ashen gray, evil creatures are immune to the weapon's extra damage, and the weapon counts as an evil and cold iron weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 6th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <a href="#channel-smite">Channel Smite</a>, <em><a href="#align-weapon">align weapon</a></em>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Huntsman</strong>: A huntsman weapon helps its wielder locate and capture quarry. When the weapon is held in hand, the wielder gains an enhancement bonus on <a href="#survival">Survival</a> checks made to track any creature the weapon has damaged in the past day. It deals +1d6 damage to creatures the wielder has tracked with <a href="#survival">Survival</a> in the past day.</p>
<p>Moderate divination; CL 7th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#detect-animals-or-plants">detect animals or plants</a></em>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Jurist</strong>: When an inquisitor wielder uses her judgment class ability, this weapon grants her an enhancement bonus on her <a href="#perception">Perception</a> checks and CMD. The bonus is +1 on the first round of her judgment, and increases by +1 each round, to a maximum of +3 on the third and following rounds.</p>
<p>Moderate transmutation; CL 4th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#owl-s-wisdom">owl's wisdom</a></em>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Menacing</strong>: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. This weapon property helps allies deal with flanked foes. When the wielder is adjacent to a creature that is being flanked by an ally, the flanking bonus on attack rolls for all flanking allies increases by +2. This ability works even if the wielder is not one of the characters flanking the creature.</p>
<p>Moderate illusion; CL 10th; <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#phantasmal-killer">phantasmal killer</a></em>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Transformative</strong>: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A <em><a href="#transformative">transformative</a> weapon</em> alters its shape at its wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium <em><a href="#transformative">transformative</a> longsword</em> can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small <em><a href="#transformative">transformative</a> greatsword</em> can become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the -2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon properties, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a <em><a href="#weapons-keen">keen</a> <a href="#transformative">transformative</a> weapon</em> functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the <em><a href="#weapons-keen">keen</a></em> property when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape.</p>

<p><strong>Beaststrike Club</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 6th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 7,300 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 3 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 club</em> is often decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of damage changes to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as <a href="#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> (bite) or the <em><a href="#bloody-claws">bloody claws</a></em> spell. If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wild shape to increase the weapon's damage by one step for the duration of that wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape.</p>

<p><strong>Blade of Binding</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint conjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 3rd</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 12,350 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 8 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 greatsword</em> is decorated with a chain motif. On a successful hit with the sword against a creature of the wielder's size or smaller creature, the wielder can attempt to start a grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wielder succeeds at the grapple, the sword blade transforms into a metal chain and wraps around the target, giving the wielder a +5 bonus on further grapple checks against the target. If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle).</p>
<p>The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling or pinning the target; if so, the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition (<a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound creature. If the chain is destroyed, it reverts to sword form and the weapon gains the broken condition.</p>

<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 9th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 6,812 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 8 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The head of this <em>+1 heavy mace</em> is made from a single piece of roughly spherical granite. Once per day the wielder can command the mace to release this head, which grows to the size of a Large boulder and rolls quickly in a direction the wielder specifies. The boulder rolls in a straight line up to 60 feet, trampling everything in its path for 3d8+5 damage (Reflex half DC 19). The boulder collapses into rubble and dust at the end of its path or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break through or roll over, creating a 10-foot-square area of difficult terrain. A new stone mace-head grows on the weapon's haft over the next 24 hours, and it is unusable as a weapon until the head regrows.</p>

<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint conjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 5th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 196 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This gritty and irregular <em>+1 sling bullet</em>explodes into a cloud of choking dust when it successfully strikes its target. This fills a 5-foot cube and follows the target for 1d6 rounds before dispersing. Any creature ending its turn in the cloud must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened and blinded for 1 round.</p>

<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 15th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 65,310 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 <a href="#weapons-dancing">dancing</a> short sword</em> automatically rises up to defend a fallen or sleeping wielder. To trigger the sword's activation, the wielder must fall unconscious or die while wielding the weapon or holding it in hand. Thereafter, should any creature other than an ally of the wielder attempt to touch or strike him with melee attacks, the sword attacks that creature for up to 4 rounds. After 4 rounds, the weapon drops in the wielder's square. Unless the <em><a href="#guarding-blade-">guarding blade</a></em> is an intelligent item, it lacks the wits to make decisions about which is the best opponent to attack, and when confronted by multiple opponents attacking the wielder it tends to select a random target each round.</p>

<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint evocation; <strong>CL</strong> 5th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 4,310 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 10 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This ornately designed <em>+1 lance</em> streams with ribbons and small favors, allowing a wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount. A successful hit with a <em><a href="#lance-of-jousting">lance of jousting</a></em> on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a <a href="#ride">Ride</a> check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although used in combat to remove a mounted foe's advantage, use of a <em><a href="#lance-of-jousting">lance of jousting</a></em> in a tournament or similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of cheating.</p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <a href="#craft-magic-arms-and-armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <em><a href="#bull-s-strength">bull's strength</a></em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 2,105 gp</p>
<p><strong>Ricochet Hammer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate transmutation; <strong>CL</strong> 7th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 20,301 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 <a href="#weapons-returning">returning</a> <a href="#light">light</a> hammer</em> can strike multiple foes with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to a attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting and has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the <em><a href="#weapons-returning">returning</a></em> property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as <em><a href="#true-strike">true strike</a></em>) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round.</p>

<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate evocation; <strong>CL</strong> 10th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 18,310; <strong>Weight</strong> 10 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 <a href="#weapons-keen">keen</a> lance</em> has the ability to penetrate and destroy shields. Whenever its wielder uses it to successfully strike an opponent who carries a shield, the opponent's shield takes the same damage as the opponent. If the wielder uses the lance to make a sunder attack against a shield, it bypasses the shield's hardness.</p>

<p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate evocation; <strong>CL</strong> 9th</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 1,516 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This <em>+1 <a href="#weapons-flaming">flaming</a> arrow</em> continues to burn its target each round, dealing 1d6 fire damage on the attacker's turn for the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow requires a DC 10 <a href="#heal">Heal</a> check and prevents any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow from himself).

<h1 id="wondrous-items">Wondrous Items</h1>
<p>Wondrous items is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups of magic items. Any creature can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description, such as requiring a particular class feature).</p>
<p><strong>All Tools Vest</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> faint conjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 1st</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong> chest; <strong>Price</strong> 1,800 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 5 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The stitching along the many pockets of this light leather vest depicts cheerful laborers going about their daily work. Once per day, as a standard action, the wearer can speak its command word and order it to bring forth all the standard tools required to make checks for any one <a href="#craft">Craft</a> skill. These tools appear in the countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another creature touches them, whichever comes first.</p>

<p><strong>Slot</strong> neck; <strong>Price</strong> 20,000 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Each silver link that makes up this heavy necklace represents a well-known concept of arcane theory. A universalist wizard who selects the necklace as his bonded object (which counts as an amulet) may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chose “evocation” when he prepared his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared <em><a href="#fireball">fireball</a></em> into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes seem, ever so briefly, to flicker in and out of existence. A transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously cast <em><a href="#disintegrate">disintegrate</a></em> in place of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.</p>

<p>These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any creature wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability damage each day as if receiving complete bed rest regardless of activity (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>191). A creature actually receiving long-term care (from the <a href="#heal">Heal</a> skill) or complete bed rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each day. The bandages are destroyed once removed or when the wearer recovers all hit points and ability damage, whichever comes first.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>A <em>lord's banner</em> is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.</p>
<p>A <em>lord's banner</em> may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.</p>
<p><em>Crusades</em>: A noble-looking <em>lord's banner of crusades</em> emits a <em><a href="#hallow">hallow</a></em> effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design). The banner displays the faith's holy symbol along with the owner's crest.</p>
<p><em>Swiftness</em>: A group or army that are traveling under a <em>lord's banner of swiftness</em> can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.</p>
<p><em>Terror</em>: Enemies of the bearer of a <em>lord's banner of terror</em>, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked by the banner for 1 day.</p>
<p><em>Victory</em>: Allies of the owner of a <em>lord's banner of victory</em> gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner.</p>

<h1 id="new-rules">New Rules</h1>
<p>Although the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>provides a complete game, along with guidelines and examples to aid GMs in creation of any new rules components their adventures might require, the open-ended nature of the rules allows for endless expansion and refinement. While any rules subsystem beyond those in the core rules should be considered optional, GMs should feel free to adopt, even invent, additional elements if doing so helps make battle feel more cinematic, increases players' investments in their characters, or simply make the game more fun. This chapter presents three new rules subsystems designed explicitly to improve Pathfinder games in those three ways. Although the majority of this book is designed to provide new rules for players, any new content herein should be approved by their GM before it sees use. In the case of this chapter's content, these new features exist exclusively for GMs to consider and potentially adopt into their adventures. While most of these elements favor the players, there's no reason they need to remain solely options for PCs; many cunning monsters would be readily able to make use of new combat maneuvers, while significant villains might be able to rely on hero points as well.</p>
<p>Noted here are the three new rules subsystems presented in this chapter, along with reasons why GMs might choose to incorporate them into their games.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#combat-maneuvers">Combat Maneuvers</a></strong>: Expanding upon the combat maneuvers included in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>—such as disarm, grapple, trip, and others—these new options give all combatants new actions and opportunities in battle, regardless of their race or class. Intended to make melee more flexible and dynamic, these new tactics allow for greater control of opponents on the battlefield and open the door for additional uses of various debilitating conditions and colorful effects.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#hero-points">Hero Points</a></strong>: A common house rule standardized and expanded for the Pathfinder RPG, this system allows players a measure of control over fate and random dice rolls. Rather than having the outcome of an adventure's worth of effort come down to or be thwarted by simple bad luck, hero points grant the PCs a resource by which they can influence destiny, or at least have a second chance when they need it most.</p>
<p><a href="#traits"><strong>Traits</strong></a>: This system gives players a way to draw benefits from their characters' histories and backgrounds, giving players cause to invest more thought into their characters' lives while providing GMs with hooks to further link PCs to the greater campaign.</p>
<h2 id="combat-maneuvers">Combat Maneuvers</h2>
<p>There's much more nuance to the ebb and flow of battle then merely charging into the fray and hacking away, or tumbling under an opponent's guard to attack from a more advantageous position. The Pathfinder RPG's combat rules, while both detailed and flexible, are meant to provide a simulation of battle, not necessarily an exacting blow by blow representation of combat's every moment. An attack roll that doesn't deal damage, for example, might mean the attacker's blade glanced off an opponent's armor, was deflected by magical force, or was merely dodged. By the same token, the game doesn't differentiate between a normal punch and a desperate clap to the ear. Without drawing away from the interpretive elements many GMs enjoy in their conflicts, the combat maneuvers here take a step away from vagaries, providing a variety of colorful new battle tactics. These maneuvers provide several exciting new options in battle and add a greater degree of cinematic detail to any conflict.</p>
<p>Combat maneuvers allow a character to perform special actions in combat, other than just attacking with a weapon or casting a spell. While the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> covers the most common sorts of combat maneuvers that a character might perform, the combat maneuver mechanics can be used for a wide variety of tricks and stunts.</p>
<p>The following four combat maneuvers can be made using the same rules for all other <a href="../combat.html#_combat-maneuvers">combat maneuvers</a>. Each one requires the attacking character to make an attack roll, adding in his Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB) in place of his normal attack bonuses. If the result is equal to or greater than the target's Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD), the maneuver is a success. The drag and reposition maneuvers have varying levels of success depending on how much the attacker's roll exceeds the target's CMD.</p>
<h2 id="dirty-trick">Dirty Trick</h2>
<p>You can attempt to hinder a foe in melee as a standard action. This maneuver covers any sort of situational attack that imposes a penalty on a foe for a short period of time. Examples include kicking sand into an opponent's face to blind him for 1 round, pulling down an enemy's pants to halve his speed, or hitting a foe in a sensitive spot to make him sickened for a round. The GM is the arbiter of what can be accomplished with this maneuver, but it cannot be used to impose a permanent penalty, and the results can be undone if the target spends a move action. If you do not have the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_improved-dirty-trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a> feat or a similar ability, attempting a dirty trick provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.</p>
<p>If your attack is successful, the target takes a penalty. The penalty is limited to one of the following conditions: blinded, dazzled, deafened, entangled, shaken, or sickened. This condition lasts for 1 round. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD, the penalty lasts 1 additional round. This penalty can usually be removed if the target spends a move action. If you possess the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_greater-dirty-trick">Greater Dirty Trick</a> feat, the penalty lasts for 1d4 rounds, plus 1 round for every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD. In addition, removing the condition requires the target to spend a standard action.</p>
<h2 id="drag">Drag</h2>
<p>You can attempt to drag a foe as a standard action. You can only drag an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. The aim of this maneuver is to drag a foe in a straight line behind you without doing any harm. If you do not have the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_improved-drag">Improved Drag</a> feat or a similar ability, initiating a drag provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.</p>
<p>If your attack is successful, both you and your target are moved 5 feet back, with your opponent occupying your original space and you in the space behind that in a straight line. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD, you can drag the target back an additional 5 feet. You must be able to move with the target to perform this maneuver. If you do not have enough movement, the drag goes to the maximum amount of movement available to you and ends.</p>
<p>An enemy being moved by a drag does not provoke an attack of opportunity because of the movement unless you possess the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_greater-drag">Greater Drag</a> feat. You cannot move a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle. If there is another creature in the way of your movement, the drag ends adjacent to that creature.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong>: Some characters or types of creatures prove particularly sure-footed, making them more difficult to overthrow and move around the battlefield. Any racial ability that grants a bonus to CMD versus bull rush attempts grants the same bonus against drag combat maneuvers.</p>
<h2 id="reposition">Reposition</h2>
<p>You can attempt to reposition a foe to a different location as a standard action. You can only reposition an opponent that is no more than one size category larger than you. A reposition attempts to force a foe to move to a different position in relation to your location without doing any harm. If you do not have the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_improved-reposition">Improved Reposition</a> feat or a similar ability, attempting to reposition a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. You cannot use this maneuver to move a foe into a space that is intrinsically dangerous, such as a pit or <em><a href="../spells/wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire">wall of fire</a></em>.</p>
<p>If your attack is successful, you may move your target 5 feet to a new location. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD, you can move the target an additional 5 feet. The target must remain within your reach at all times during this movement, except for the final 5 feet of movement, which can be to a space adjacent to your reach.</p>
<p>An enemy being moved by a reposition does not provoke an attack of opportunity because of the movement unless you possess the Greater Reposition feat. You cannot move a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle.</p>
<h2 id="steal">Steal</h2>
<p>You can attempt to take an item from a foe as a standard action. This maneuver can be used in melee to take any item that is neither held nor hidden in a bag or pack. You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to attempt this maneuver. You must select the item to be taken before the check is made. Items that are simply tucked into a belt or loosely attached (such as brooches or necklaces) are the easiest to take. Items fastened to a foe (such as cloaks, sheathed weapons, or pouches) are more difficult to take, and give the opponent a +5 bonus (or greater) to his CMD. Items that are closely worn (such as armor, backpacks, boots, clothing, or rings) cannot be taken with this maneuver. Items held in the hands (such as wielded weapons or wands) also cannot be taken with the steal maneuver—you must use the disarm combat maneuver instead. The GM is the final arbiter of what items can be taken. If you do not have the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_improved-steal">Improved Steal</a> feat or a similar ability, attempting to steal an object provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.</p>
<p>Although this maneuver can only be performed if the target is within your reach, you can use a whip to steal an object from a target within range with a –4 penalty on the attack roll.</p>
<p>If your attack is successful, you may take one item from your opponent. You must be able to reach the item to be taken (subject to GM discretion). Your enemy is immediately aware of this theft unless you possess the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_greater-steal">Greater Steal</a> feat.</p>
<h2 id="hero-points">Hero Points</h2>
<p>A PC can elect not to use the hero point system, instead relying more on his skills and abilities. Such characters do not receive hero points, regardless of the source, and can never benefit from their use. In exchange, such characters receive a bonus feat at 1st level. The option to allow such antiheroes in the game is subject to GM discretion.</p>
<h3 id="antiheroes">Antiheroes</h3>
<p>Although all of the options presented in this book should be carefully considered before they are added to your game, hero points deserve closer inspection. Although hero points do not drastically increase the power of the PCs, they do grant the PCs the ability to greatly increase their chances of success during critical moments. While the game itself is set up to give the player characters an edge, hero points take that a bit further, possibly more so than you might be comfortable with.</p>
<p>The value to hero points is that they add dramatic tension to the climax of your game. Most uses of hero points do not guarantee success, making the moment they are used even more important to the players. Hero points are a very limited resource and their use should be described with additional detail and dramatic style. Used in this way, they can help create very memorable sessions for both you and your players.</p>
<p>Although NPCs do not generally receive hero points, there are ways that they can use these mechanics. A number of spells and magic items, as well as the Hero's Fortune feat, grant hero points to a character. Such hero points should be used sparingly, and should be reserved for major villains or truly important characters. If you use them too much, the players will begin to resent the system, making it more of a problem than an opportunity to enhance the game.</p>
<h3 id="hero-points-for-gms">Hero Points for GMs</h3>
<p>There are moments in any struggle that influence the outcome. Does the brave warrior lay low the villain before he can finish casting a devastating spell? Does the sly rogue avoid detection as she sneaks into the giant chieftain's lair? Does the pious cleric finish casting her healing spell before the rain of arrows ends the life of her companions? Just a few die rolls decide each of these critical moments, and while failure is always a possibility, true heroes find a way to succeed, despite the odds. Hero points represent this potential for greatness. They give heroes the chance to succeed even when the dice turn against them.</p>
<p>Hero points are only awarded to player characters. NPCs, animal companions, familiars, cohorts, and mounts do not receive hero points. Unlike other points in the game, hero points do not renew over time or with rest. Once spent, they are gone forever. Hero points are awarded as a character gains levels or whenever a character accomplishes a truly heroic feat. The GM is the final arbiter on the award and use of hero points.</p>
<h2 id="awarding-hero-points">Awarding Hero Points</h2>
<p>Each character begins play with 1 hero point, regardless of her level. In addition, whenever a character gains a level, she earns an additional hero point. Aside from these basic rules, awarding additional hero points is up to the GM. The following options are just some of the ways that a GM might award additional hero points.</p>
<p><strong>Character Story</strong>: GMs can award a hero point for the completion of a written character backstory. This reward encourages players to take an active role in the history of the game. In addition, the GM can use this backstory to generate a pivotal moment for your character concerning his past. When this key event is resolved, the GM can reward another hero point. Alternatively, the GM might award a hero point for painting a miniature or drawing a character portrait in the likeness of your character, helping the rest of the group visualize your hero.</p>
<p><strong>Completing Plot Arcs</strong>: The GM might award a hero point to each of the PCs who were involved in completing a major chapter or arc in the campaign story. These hero points are awarded at the conclusion of the arc if the PCs were successful or advanced the story in a meaningful way.</p>
<p><strong>Faith</strong>: In a campaign where the gods play an important role in every character's life, hero points might represent their favor. In such a setting, the GM can award hero points to characters whenever they uphold the tenets of their faith in a grand way, or whenever they take on one of the faith's major enemies. Such hero points might be temporary, and if not spent on the task at hand, they fade away.</p>
<p><strong>Group Service</strong>: The GM can award hero points for acts outside the game as well. Buying pizza for the group, helping to clean up afterwards, or even hosting the game for a night might be worth a hero point. This sort of hero point should be given out of generosity, not as a payment.</p>
<p><strong>Heroic Acts</strong>: Whenever a character performs an exceptionally heroic act, she can be awarded a hero point. This might include anything from slaying an evil dragon when the rest of the group has fled to rescuing townsfolk from a burning building despite being terribly wounded. It does not have to be related to combat. Convincing the reticent king to send troops to help with a bandit problem or successfully jumping a wide chasm might earn a character a hero point, depending on the circumstances. Note that a hero point should only be awarded if the PC involved did not spend a hero point to accomplish the task.</p>
<p><strong>Return from the Dead</strong>: When a character dies, she does not lose any hero points she has accumulated. If she died with no hero points remaining, she gains 1 hero point when she is brought back from the dead through powerful magic, such as <em><a href="../spells/raiseDead.html#_raise-dead">raise dead</a></em> or <em><a href="../spells/resurrection.html#_resurrection">resurrection</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Hero Points</strong>: Characters can have no more than 3 hero points at any one time. Excess hero points are lost.</p>
<h3 id="using-hero-points">Using Hero Points</h3>
<p>Hero points can be spent at any time and do not require an action to use (although the actions they modify consume part of your character's turn as normal). You cannot spend more than 1 hero point during a single round of combat. Whenever a hero point is spent, it can have any one of the following effects.</p>
<p><strong>Act Out of Turn</strong>: You can spend a hero point to take your turn immediately. Treat this as a readied action, moving your initiative to just before the currently acting creature. You may only take a move or a standard action on this turn.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: If used before a roll is made, a hero point grants you a +8 luck bonus to any one d20 roll. If used after a roll is made, this bonus is reduced to +4. You can use a hero point to grant this bonus to another character, as long as you are in the same location and your character can reasonably affect the outcome of the roll (such as distracting a monster, shouting words of encouragement, or otherwise aiding another with the check). Hero points spent to aid another character grant only half the listed bonus (+4 before the roll, +2 after the roll).</p>
<p><strong>Extra Action</strong>: You can spend a hero point on your turn to gain an additional standard or move action this turn.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: If you feel stuck at one point in the adventure, you can spend a hero point and petition the GM for a hint about what to do next. If the GM feels that there is no information to be gained, the hero point is not spent.</p>
<p><strong>Recall</strong>: You can spend a hero point to recall a spell you have already cast or to gain another use of a special ability that is otherwise limited. This should only be used on spells and abilities possessed by your character that recharge on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Reroll</strong>: You may spend a hero point to reroll any one d20 roll you just made. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can petition the GM to allow a hero point to be used to attempt nearly anything that would normally be almost impossible. Such uses are not guaranteed and should be considered carefully by the GM. Possibilities include casting a single spell that is one level higher than you could normally cast (or a 1st-level spell if you are not a spellcaster), making an attack that blinds a foe or bypasses its damage reduction entirely, or attempting to use <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> to convince a raging dragon to give up its attack. Regardless of the desired action, the attempt should be accompanied by a difficult check or penalty on the attack roll. No additional hero points may be spent on such an attempt, either by the character or her allies.</p>
<p><strong>Cheat Death</strong>: A character can spend 2 hero points to cheat death. How this plays out is up to the GM, but generally the character is left alive, with negative hit points but stable. For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends 2 hero points, the GM decides that the arrow pierced the character's holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. Cheating death is the only way for a character to spend more than 1 hero point in a turn. The character can spend hero points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC.</p>
<h3 id="additional-hero-point-rules">Additional Hero Point Rules</h3>
<p>Since hero points themselves are an optional rules system, other mechanics that go along with hero points have been included here to avoid confusion in the rest of the book. The following feats, spells, and magic items all have to do with hero points in one way or another.</p>
<h2 id="hero-point-feats">Hero Point Feats</h2>
<p>The following feats enhance your ability to store and gain hero points.</p>
<h3 id="blood-of-heroes">Blood of Heroes</h3>
<p>You have a sense of destiny about you and always seem to succeed, even when the odds are against you.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Hero's Fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you gain a level, you gain 2 hero points instead of 1.</p>
<p><strong>Normal</strong>: Whenever you gain a level, you gain 1 hero point.</p>
<h3 id="heros-fortune">Hero's Fortune</h3>
<p>Even at the start of your career, it was clear that you had a chance at greatness, and your legend continues to grow with every adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a hero point. The maximum number of hero points you can have at any one time is increased to 5.</p>
<p><strong>Normal</strong>: You can have no more than 3 hero points at one time.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: NPCs who take this feat receive 1 hero point and can have up to 3 (not 5).</p>
<h3 id="luck-of-heroes">Luck of Heroes</h3>
<p>To others, it seems that you always have a bit of luck around you.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Hero's Fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you spend a hero point to reroll a die roll or to grant yourself a bonus before a die roll is made, there is a chance that the hero point is not spent. Whenever you spend a hero point, roll a d20. If the result is greater than 15, the hero point is not spent. You cannot use this feat when you cheat death.</p>
<h2 id="hero-point-spells">Hero Point Spells</h2>
<p>The following spells grant temporary hero points or prevent characters from using hero points.</p>
<p><strong>Heroic Fortune</strong></p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>
<p>This spell grants 1 hero point to the target. This hero point must be spent before the duration expires, or it is lost. The bonus hero point is spent before any other hero points the target might possess.</p>
<p><strong>Heroic Fortune, Mass</strong></p>

<p>This spell functions like <em>heroic fortune</em>, except as noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Malediction</strong></p>
<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy [death, evil]; <strong>Level</strong> sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> living creature touched</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous/1 minute per HD of the target; see text</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You utter a dire curse over the body of a dying creature, allowing you to consume its waning life force. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has –1 or fewer hit points. If the target fails its saving throw, it dies and you gain 1 hero point for every 5 Hit Dice possessed by the target (minimum 1, maximum 3). These hero points last for a number of minutes equal to the target's Hit Dice. Any hero points remaining when this spell ends are lost.</p>
<p><strong>Severed Fate</strong></p>
<p><strong>School</strong> enchantment; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3, witch 2</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> one living creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level</p>

This effect can be removed by <em><a href="../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>, <a href="../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse">remove curse</a></em>, or other similar effects.</p>
<p><strong>Unravel Destiny</strong></p>
<p><strong>School</strong> divination; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>
<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>
<p>You utter a dire portent, causing destiny and fate to unravel around the target. This profoundly disturbing effect causes the target to suffer a cumulative –2 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for every hero point it possesses. The target can reduce this penalty by spending hero points normally, but it takes 2d6 points of damage for each hero point spent while this spell is in effect.</p>
<h2 id="hero-point-magic-items">Hero Point Magic Items</h2>
<p>The following magic items grant characters additional hero points or allow them the possibility of recovering points as they are spent.</p>

<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
<p>Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character's race or class. They can enhance your character's skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn't just another kind of power you can add on to your character—it's a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world. Think of character traits as “story seeds” for your background; after you pick your two traits, you'll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character's personality and history. Alternatively, if you've already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Many traits grant a new type of bonus: a “trait” bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack—they're intended to give player characters a slight edge, not a secret backdoor way to focus all of a character's traits on one type of bonus and thus gain an unseemly advantage. It's certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a “Courageous” trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait is on both the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn't mean you're any more brave if you choose both versions than if you choose only one.</p>
<p>Character traits are only for player characters. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC must “buy” them with the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_additional-traits">Additional Traits feat</a>. Player characters are special; they're the stars of the game, after all, and it makes sense that they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-traits">Gaining Traits</h2>
<p>When you create your character for a campaign, ask your GM how many traits you can select. In most cases, a new PC should gain two traits, effectively gaining what amounts to a bonus feat at character creation. Some GMs may wish to adjust this number somewhat, depending upon their style of play; you may only be able to pick one trait, or your GM might allow three or more. Even if your GM normally doesn't allow bonus traits, you might still be able to pick up some with the <a href="advancedFeats.html#_additional-traits">Additional Traits feat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-traits">Types of Traits</h2>
<p>There are five types of character traits to choose from: basic (split among four categories: Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social), campaign, race, regional, and religion. Only a selection of character traits is listed here—more traits from all categories can be found in Pathfinder Player Companions, available at your local game store or from <strong>paizo.com</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Traits</strong>: There are a total of 40 basic traits, which are split evenly among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren't tied to specific classes. It's perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are “generic,” and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Traits</strong>: These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new campaign. Campaign traits tailored to a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path's Player's Guide, available at <strong>paizo.com</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Race Traits</strong>: Race traits are keyed to specific races or ethnicities, which your character must belong to in order to select the trait. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a <em>reincarnation</em> spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist—only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Traits</strong>: Regional traits are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At 1st level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character's place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character's background.</p>
<p><strong>Religion Traits</strong>: Religion traits indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed below under Restrictions on Trait Selection.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions-on-trait-selection">Restrictions on Trait Selection</h2>
<p>There are a few rules governing trait selection. To begin with, your GM controls how many bonus traits a PC begins with; the default assumption is two traits. When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits (the four basic traits each count as a separate list for this purpose). Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.</p>
<p>Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character's development, either events from before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the Additional Traits feat) ones that happened while adventuring. Even if your character becomes a hermit and abandons society, he'll still retain his legacy of growing up an aristocrat if he took the relevant social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits—since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, your character can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if he switches religions. In this case, consult your GM for your options. She may simply rule that your character loses that trait, or she might allow him to pick a new religion trait tied to his new deity. Another option is that if your character abandons a religion, he loses the associated religion trait until he gains an experience level, at which point he may replace a lost religion trait with a basic faith trait.</p>
<h2 id="basic-traits">Basic Traits</h2>
<p>Basic traits are broken down into four categories. Combat traits focus on martial and physical aspects of your character's background. Faith traits focus on his religious and philosophical leanings. Magic traits focus on any magical events or training he may have had in his past. And Social traits focus on your character's social class or upbringing.</p>
<h3 id="combat-traits">Combat Traits</h3>
<p>These traits are associated with combat, battle, and physical prowess; they give characters minor bonuses in battle and represent conflicts and physical struggles in the character's backstory.</p>
<p><strong>Anatomist</strong>: You have studied the workings of anatomy, either as a student at university or as an apprentice mortician or necromancer. You know where to aim your blows to strike vital organs, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all rolls made to confirm critical hits.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Expert</strong>: You have worn armor as long as you can remember, either as part of your training to become a knight's squire or simply because you were seeking to emulate a hero. Your childhood armor wasn't the real thing as far as protection, but it did encumber you as much as real armor would have, and you've grown used to moving in such suits with relative grace. When you wear armor of any sort, reduce that suit's armor check penalty by 1, to a minimum check penalty of 0.</p>
<p><strong>Bullied</strong>: You were bullied often as a child, and you are now constantly ready to defend yourself with your fists when an enemy comes near. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attacks of opportunity attack rolls made with unarmed strikes. Note that this trait does not grant the ability to make attacks of opportunity with your unarmed strikes—you must have a level of monk, the <a href="../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> feat, or some other similar power to gain the use of this character trait. However, that doesn't prevent you from selecting this trait. You simply cannot make use of it until a later point if you do.</p>
<p><strong>Courageous</strong>: Your childhood was brutal, yet you persevered primarily through force of will and faith that no matter how hard things might get, as long as you kept a level head you'd make it through. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p><strong>Deft Dodger</strong>: Growing up in a rough neighborhood or a dangerous environment has honed your senses. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves.</p>
<p><strong>Dirty Fighter</strong>: You wouldn't have lived to make it out of childhood without the aid of a sibling, friend, or companion on whom you could always count to distract your enemies long enough for you to do a little bit more damage than normal. That companion may be another PC or an NPC (who may even be recently departed from your side). When you hit a foe you are flanking, you deal an additional 1 point of damage (this damage is added to your base damage, and is multiplied on a critical hit). This additional damage is a trait bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Fencer</strong>: You trained with blades for long hours as a youth, either taking lessons in the genteel art of fencing from tutors paid for by your parents or by being taken under the wing of a disenfranchised fencer who may have turned to a life of crime. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attacks of opportunity made with daggers, swords, and similar bladed weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Killer</strong>: You made your first kill at a very young age and found the task of war or murder to your liking. You either take particular pride in a well-placed blow, or find vile pleasure in such a strike as you twist the blade to maximize the pain. You deal additional damage equal to your weapon's critical hit modifier when you score a successful critical hit with a weapon; this additional damage is added to the final total, and is not multiplied by the critical hit multiple itself. This extra damage is a trait bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Reactionary</strong>: You were bullied often as a child, but never quite developed an offensive response. Instead, you became adept at anticipating sudden attacks and reacting to danger quickly. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.</p>
<p><strong>Resilient</strong>: Growing up in a poor neighborhood or in the unforgiving wilds often forced you to subsist on food and water from doubtful sources. You've built up your mettle as a result, and gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves.</p>
<h3 id="faith-traits">Faith Traits</h3>
<p>These traits rely upon conviction of spirit, perception, and religion, but are not directly tied to the worship of a specific deity. You do not need a patron deity to gain a Faith Trait, as these traits can represent conviction in yourself or your philosophy just as easily as they can represent dedication to a deity.</p>
<p><strong>Birthmark</strong>: You were born with a strange birthmark that looks very similar to the holy symbol of the god you chose to worship later in life. This birthmark can serve you as a divine focus for casting spells, and as a physical manifestation of your faith, it increases your devotion to your god—you gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Caretaker</strong>: As the child of an herbalist or an assistant in a temple infirmary, you often had to assist in tending to the sick and wounded. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/heal.html#_heal">Heal</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/heal.html#_heal">Heal</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Child of the Temple</strong>: You have long served at a temple in a city, and not only did you pick up on many of the nobility's customs, you spent much time in the temple libraries studying your faith. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nobility) and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Devotee of the Green</strong>: Your faith in the natural world or one of the gods of nature makes it easy for you to pick up on related concepts. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (geography) and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of Faith</strong>: Your mentor, the person who invested your faith in you from an early age, took steps to ensure that you understood that what powers your divine magic is no different than that which powers the magic of other religions. This philosophy makes it easier for you to interact with others who may not share your views. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>History of Heresy</strong>: You were raised with heretical views that have made it difficult for you to accept most religious beliefs and often caused you or those you love to be treated as pariahs. As a result, you have turned your back on religious teachings, and as long as you do not possess any levels in a class that grants divine spellcasting power, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws made against divine spells.</p>
<p><strong>Indomitable Faith</strong>: You were born in a region where your faith was not popular, but you never abandoned it. Your constant struggle to maintain your own faith has bolstered your drive; you gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Sacred Conduit</strong>: Your birth was particularly painful and difficult for your mother, who needed potent divine magic to ensure that you survived (your mother may or may not have). In any event, that magic infused you from an early age, and you now channel divine energy with greater ease than most. Whenever you channel energy, you gain a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of your channeled energy.</p>
<p><strong>Sacred Touch</strong>: You were exposed to a potent source of positive energy as a child, perhaps by being born under the right cosmic sign, or maybe because one of your parents was a gifted healer. As a standard action, you may automatically stabilize a dying creature merely by touching it.</p>
<p><strong>Scholar of the Great Beyond</strong>: Your great interests as a child did not lie with current events or the mundane—you have always felt out of place, as if you were born in the wrong era. You take to philosophical discussions of the Great Beyond and of historical events with ease. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (history) and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (planes) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<h3 id="magic-traits">Magic Traits</h3>
<p>These traits are associated with magic and focus on spellcasting and manipulating magic. You need not be a spellcaster to take a Magic Trait (although several of these traits aren't as useful to non-spellcasters). Magic Traits can represent a character's early exposure to magical effects or childhood studies of magic.</p>
<p><strong>Classically Schooled</strong>: Your apprenticeship or early education was particularly focused on the direct application of magic. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerously Curious</strong>: You have always been intrigued by magic, possibly because you were the child of a magician or priest. You often snuck into your parent's laboratory or shrine to tinker with spell components and magic devices, and frequently caused quite a bit of damage and headaches for your parent as a result. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/useMagicDevice.html#_use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/useMagicDevice.html#_use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Focused Mind</strong>: Your childhood was either dominated by lessons of some sort (whether musical, academic, or other) or by a horrible home life that encouraged your ability to block out distractions and focus on the immediate task at hand. You gain a +2 trait bonus on concentration checks.</p>
<p><strong>Gifted Adept</strong>: Your interest in magic was inspired by witnessing a spell being cast in a particularly dramatic method, perhaps even one that affected you physically or spiritually. This early exposure to magic has made it easier for you to work similar magic on your own. Pick one spell when you choose this trait—from this point on, whenever you cast that spell, its effects manifest at +1 caster level.</p>
<p><strong>Hedge Magician</strong>: You apprenticed for a time to a craftsman who often built magic items, and he taught you many handy shortcuts and cost-saving techniques. Whenever you craft a magic item, you reduce the required gp cost to make the item by 5%.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Knack</strong>: You were raised, either wholly or in part, by a magical creature, either after it found you abandoned in the woods or because your parents often left you in the care of a magical minion. This constant exposure to magic has made its mysteries easy for you to understand, even when you turn your mind to other devotions and tasks. Pick a class when you gain this trait—your caster level in that class gains a +2 trait bonus as long as this bonus doesn't raise your caster level above your current Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Lineage</strong>: One of your parents was a gifted spellcaster who not only used metamagic often, but also developed many magical items and perhaps even a new spell or two—and you have inherited a fragment of this greatness. Pick one spell when you choose this trait. When you apply metamagic feats to this spell, treat its actual level as 1 lower for determining the spell's final adjusted level.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Talent</strong>: Either from inborn talent, the whimsy of the gods, or obsessive study of strange tomes, you have mastered the use of a cantrip. Choose a 0-level spell. You may cast that spell once per day as a spell-like ability. This spell-like ability is cast at your highest caster level gained; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Prodigy</strong>: Mathematics has always come easily for you, and you have always been able to “see the math” in the physical and magical world. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (engineering) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Skeptic</strong>: Growing up, you were always around magical effects to the extent that you realized much of it was mere smoke and mirrors. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against illusions.</p>
<h3 id="social-traits">Social Traits</h3>
<p>Social Traits are a sort of catch-all category—these traits reflect the social upbringing of your character, your background in high society or lack thereof, and your history with parents, siblings, friends, competitors, and enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Adopted</strong>: You were adopted and raised by someone not of your actual race, and raised in a society not your own. As a result, you picked up a race trait from your adoptive parents and society, and may immediately select a race trait from your adoptive parents' race.</p>
<p><strong>Bully</strong>: You grew up in an environment where the meek were ignored and you often had to resort to threats or violence to be heard. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Canter</strong>: You grew up among thieves and scoundrels, and their unusual speech patterns and turns of phrase don't faze you in the slightest today as a result. Anyone who attempts to use <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> to deliver a secret message to you gains a +5 bonus on his <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> check. When you attempt to intercept a secret message using <a href="../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, you gain a +5 trait bonus on the attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Charming</strong>: Blessed with good looks, you've come to depend on the fact that others find you attractive. You gain a +1 trait bonus when you use <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> on a character that is (or could be) sexually attracted to you, and a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of any language-dependent spell you cast on such characters or creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Child of the Streets</strong>: You grew up on the streets of a large city, and as a result you have developed a knack for picking pockets and hiding small objects on your person. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-Talker</strong>: You had a knack at getting yourself into trouble as a child, and as a result developed a silver tongue at an early age. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Natural-Born Leader</strong>: You've always found yourself in positions where others look up to you as a leader, and you can distinctly remember an event from your early childhood where you led several other children to accomplish a goal that each of you individually could not. All cohorts, followers, or summoned creatures under your leadership gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves to avoid mind-affecting effects. If you ever take the <a href="../feats.html#_leadership">Leadership</a> feat, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your <a href="../feats.html#_leadership">Leadership</a> score.</p>
<p><strong>Poverty-Stricken</strong>: Your childhood was tough, and your parents had to make every copper piece count. Hunger was your constant companion, and you often had to live off the land or sleep in the wild. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/survival.html#_survival">Survival</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Parents</strong>: You were born into a rich family, perhaps even the nobility, and even though you turned to a life of adventure anyway, you enjoy a one-time benefit to your initial finances—your starting cash increases to 900 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Suspicious</strong>: You discovered at an early age that someone you trusted, perhaps an older sibling or a parent, had lied to you, and lied often, about something you had taken for granted, leaving you quick to question the claims of others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> checks, and <a href="../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<h2 id="campaign-traits">Campaign Traits</h2>
<p>Campaign traits are specifically designed to tie your character into a campaign's storyline, and often give you a built-in reason to begin the first adventure. For this reason, GMs usually create their own campaign traits for their PCs. If your GM uses campaign traits, one of your starting traits must be a campaign trait. Your other trait can be chosen from one of the other types of traits.</p>
<h3 id="favored-sondaughter">Favored Son/Daughter</h3>
<p>You were born and raised in the town of Sandpoint or its surrounding farms. You know many of the region's secrets, and the locals already know who you are. You are well liked in town, and you'll have lots of friends in the region, but the town's tougher side sees you as a snitch or a pansy. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) checks, and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) is always a class skill for you. In addition, you can choose any one law-abiding citizen of Sandpoint from below as an ally; depending on the person you pick, you'll get different benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Tavern Owner</strong>: One of the town's most influential and beloved nobles. Her inn/tavern is the most popular in town, and as one of her friends, you're guaranteed a place to eat and sleep for free. She's got lots of great contacts with merchants as well, and she'll sell any of your loot for you—as a result, you gain an additional 10% over the amount of gp you normally would get from selling off treasure.</p>
<p><strong>Sherrif</strong>: The no nonsense arm of the law, is like the uncle you never had. The benefits of being close friends with the town sheriff are extensive, and you can call in favors from him once per game session. A favor can either get you out of a legal jam, hook you up with a town guard for help, or give you a one-time +10 bonus on a <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, or <a href="../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> check made against any local person.</p>
<h3 id="black-sheep">Black Sheep</h3>
<p>You were born and raised in town. You know many of the region's secrets and the locals already know who you are. You aren't quite hated in town, but folk seem to think you're a troublemaker and a bastard and not to be trusted. The town's tougher folk respect you, but the law-abiding citizens don't. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) checks, and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) is a class skill for you.

<p><strong>Apothecary</strong>: Everyone suspects the sweaty, shifty-eyed apothecary sells poisons from his cluttered, acrid smelling wreck of a shop. You're one of the few in town who know this for a fact. You start the game with 400 gp worth of poison, and the apothecary will continue to sell you poison as long as you don't spread the word.</p>
<p><strong>Bitter Nobleman</strong>: A local unscrupulous family was hit hard recently, revealing criminal ties that damaged its reputation as well. One noble is eager to rebuild his presence in town, and you're one of the ones he's selected as an agent. Choose one of the following skills: <a href="../skills/bluff.html#_bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a>, or <a href="../skills/stealth.html#_stealth">Stealth</a>. Your work for the family gives you a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.</p>

<p>You are not from town; you've recently come from somewhere else and are hoping to make your fortune here. Pick one of the following reasons to be a newcomer to the area.</p>
<p><strong>Lore Seeker</strong>: The secrets of an ancient fallen civilization intrigue you, particularly the magical traditions of its highly mystical culture. You've studied magic intensely, and hope to increase that knowledge by adding ancient lore. You've come to the region to pursue that study, and chose the town as your base because it was out of the way of bigger cities—meaning less competition to study the ancient monuments in the region, you hope! You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) checks, and <a href="../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) is a class skill for you.

You are particularly adept at casting these spells, so they function at +1 caster level when you cast them, and their save DCs (if any) gain a +1 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Exile</strong>: For whatever reason, you were forced to flee your homeland. Chance or fate has brought you to twon, and it's here that your money ran out, leaving you stranded in this small town. You are also being pursued by enemies from your homeland, and that has made you paranoid and quick to react to danger. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.</p>
